# Whitaker Lab Project Management

[![Gitter](https://img.shields.io/gitter/room/nwjs/nw.js.svg)](https://gitter.im/WhitakerLab/Lobby)

This repository contains issues related to the management of all Whitaker Lab projects along with weekly progress records for all lab members and collaborators.

## Working open

At the Whitaker lab we are dedicated to working as openly as possible. We believe that our endeavors will be more successful through clear communication and collaboration than by keeping secrets. This repository is designed to showcase our "work in progress". You're welcome to help out along the way!

We may have private repositories if our collaborators are more comfortable with restricted working on some projects, but we aspire to "be the change" and demonstrate open working practices wherever possible.

## Onboarding

If you're new to the lab, check out the [Onboarding repository](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/Onboarding) which will talk you through the different exercises and actions for your first few weeks in the lab.

## Weekly updates

Lab members are asked to prepare for their regular meetings with Kirstie by completing their "Weekly-meetings" file and open a pull request to update the repository in advance of the meeting.
You can find the public records of these meetings in the [weekly-updates](weekly-updates) folder.

## Lab meetings

Lab meetings are held every week on Thursdays at 3pm.
Remote attendance is always supported.
Participation (even if you can't attend the meeting itself) is required from all lab members.
That means completing the three sections of the HackMD (attendance/apologies, something to share, a question to ask) in advance of the meeting, and ideally adding your comments to others' updates.

For a more detailed overview of the motivation and expectations for lab meetings see the [lab onboarding repository](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/Onboarding/blob/master/Lab-meetings.md).

You can see the schedule in the [lab-meetings](lab-meetings) folder of this repository.
