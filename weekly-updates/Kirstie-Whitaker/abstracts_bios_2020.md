### Advanced Methods for Reproducible Science

**Website**: https://osf.io/gupxv

**Date**: 5 - 10 January 2020

**Title**: The Turing Way: Transforming Research with Collaborative Working

**Abstract**:

**Bio**: Kirstie Whitaker is a research fellow at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) (London, UK) and senior research associate in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge.
Her work covers a broad range of interests and methods, but the driving principle is to improve the lives of neurodivergent people and people with mental health conditions.
Dr Whitaker uses magnetic resonance imaging to study child and adolescent brain development and participatory citizen science to educate non-autistic people about how they can better support autistic friends and colleagues.
She is the lead developer of [*The Turing Way*](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way), an openly developed educational resource to enable more reproducible data science.
Kirstie is a passionate advocate for making science "open for all" by promoting equity and inclusion for people from diverse backgrounds, and by changing the academic incentive structure to reward collaborative working.
She is the chair of the Turing Institute's Ethics Advisory Group, a Fulbright scholarship alumna and was a 2016/17 [Mozilla Fellow for Science](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/fellowships/fellows).
Kirstie was named, with her collaborator Petra Vertes, as a [2016 Global Thinker](https://gt.foreignpolicy.com/2016/profile/petra-vertes-and-kirstie-whitaker) by Foreign Policy magazine.

### OpenMR Benelux 2020

**Website**: https://openmrbenelux.github.io/page-openmrb-2020

**Date**: 21 January 2019

**Title**: The Turing Way: Reproducible, Inclusive, Collaborative Data Science

**Abstract**: Reproducible research is necessary to ensure that scientific work can be trusted.
By sharing data, analysis code and the computational environment used to generate the results, researchers can more effectively stand on the shoulders of their peers and colleagues and deliver high quality, trustworthy and verifiable outputs.
This requires skills in data management, library sciences, software development, and continuous integration techniques: skills that are not widely taught or expected of academic researchers.
Skills that are unreasonable, in fact, to expect in one individual team member.
*The Turing Way* is a handbook to support students, their supervisors, funders and journal editors in ensuring that reproducible research is "too easy not to do".
It includes training material on version control, analysis testing, collaborating in distributed groups, open and transparent communication skills, and effective management of diverse research projects.
*The Turing Way* is openly developed and any and all questions, comments and recommendations are welcome at our github repository: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way.
In this talk, Kirstie Whitaker, lead developer of *The Turing Way*, will take you on a whirlwind tour of the chapters that already exist, the interactive demonstrations you can use and re-use for your own research, and the directions in which we're continuing to develop.
All participants will leave the talk knowing that "Every Little Helps" when making their work reproducible, where to ask for help as they start or continue their open research journey, and how they can contribute to improve *The Turing Way* for future readers.

### Turing Urban Analytics meeting

**Date**: 11 February 2020

**Title**: Participatory citizen science to improve autistic people's lives

**Abstract**: [Autistica](https://www.autistica.org.uk/) and the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) are working together to build a participatory, citizen science platform to gather data on how sensory processing affects autistic peopleâ€™s navigation of the world.
Numerous studies have confirmed that autistic people experience sensory processing differences, and that this can significantly impact their lives.
One aspect which is not yet fully understood is how these differences affect the ways in which autistic people navigate different environments.
In this talk, I will showcase the team's process of building a project that is participatory from the ground up.
We ensure that all aspects of the project are designed and developed in collaboration with members of the autistic community.
In close collaborations with the [Open Humans](https://www.openhumans.org/about/) community, we are developing a platform for which the software, design, process and governance documentation are all open source.
I will share our progress in building and providing citizen scientists with a fine-grained consent model that supports individual contributor's personal preferences on how their data is used on the platform.
Flipping the traditional scientific study on its head, our goal is to give a voice to the autistic citizen scientists and educate neurotypical people.
We seek to crowd source expertise at scale to inform policy and design decisions for public spaces such as libraries, hospitals and schools.
Members of the Turing's Urban Analytics community will leave knowing how they can join the team and contribute their expertise to the project that same day, starting from information at [our website](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/AutisticaCitizenScience) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience).

### Talk at Center for Research and Interdisiplinarity

**Website**: https://events.cri-paris.org/e/649/cri-research-seminar-kirstie-whitaker-participatory-citizen-science-to-improve-autistic-peoples-lives

**Date**: 27 April 2020

In this talk, I will showcase the team's process of building a project that is participatory from the ground up.
We ensure that all aspects of the project are designed and developed in collaboration with members of the autistic community through focus groups and user testing in the design phase.
In close collaborations with the [Open Humans](https://www.openhumans.org/about/) community, we are developing a platform for which the software, design, process and governance documentation are all open source.
We give the individual contributors control over how their data is used on the platform.
Flipping the traditional scientific study on its head, our goal is to give a voice to autistic citizen scientists and educate neurotypical people.
We seek to empower everyone in supporting autistic people and their families in living long, healthy, happy lives.
Combining open science, participatory design, transparent governance, inclusive community management, and collaborations across academia, industry and the third sector requires a diverse, interdisciplinary community of contributors.
CRI audience members will leave knowing how they can join the team and contribute to the project that same day, starting from information at [our website](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/AutisticaCitizenScience) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience), or reuse the processes we've developed for their own citizen science research.

### Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society

**Website**: https://www.manlitphil.ac.uk/events/there-are-no-adults-my-journey-realising-no-one-has-plan

**Date**: *Postponed due to COVID19*

**Title**: There are no adults: My journey to realising that no one has a plan!

**Abstract**: From the outside I'm an accomplished scientist:
I build websites, write code, and study how brain networks change over time.
But it doesn't feel that way to me.
It feels like I'm still "making it up as I go along".
In this talk, I'll bring you behind the curtain: a masters degree focused mainly on skiing rather than learning how MRI machines work, a PhD with a lot of cycling in the California sunshine.
And I'll reassure you that your uncertainty is both common and beneficial.
It is through exploring the world, and the many options that the future holds, that we can achieve our wildest dreams.

**Bio**: Kirstie Whitaker is a research fellow at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) (London, UK) and a senior research associate in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge.
After leaving Withington Girls' School in 2001 she was awarded a BSc with first class honours in Physics from the University of Bristol and then an MSc in Medical Physics from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.
She completed her PhD in Neuroscience at the University of California, Berkeley in 2012 and her postdoctoral work was conducted in the Brain Mapping Unit at the University of Cambridge from 2012 to 2017.
Her work covers a broad range of interests and methods, but the driving principle is to improve the lives of people with mental health disorders.
Kirstie is a passionate advocate for making science "open for all" by promoting equity and inclusion for people from diverse backgrounds, and by changing the academic incentive structure to reward collaborative working.
She is a Fulbright scholarship alumna and 2016/17 [Mozilla Fellow for Science](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/fellowships/fellows).
