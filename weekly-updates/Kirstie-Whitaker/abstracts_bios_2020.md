# Abstracts and bios

This is a file of all the talk abstracts and bios I write for events in 2020.

Hopefully I'll be able to re-use at least some of them ;)

They're ordered by date of presentation so ideally they're a little easier to find.

### OpenMR Benelux 2020

**Date**: 21 January 2019

**Title**: The Turing Way: Reproducible, Inclusive, Collaborative Data Science

**Abstract**: Reproducible research is necessary to ensure that scientific work can be trusted.
By sharing data, analysis code and the computational environment used to generate the results, researchers can more effectively stand on the shoulders of their peers and colleagues and deliver high quality, trustworthy and verifiable outputs.
This requires skills in data management, library sciences, software development, and continuous integration techniques: skills that are not widely taught or expected of academic researchers.
Skills that are unreasonable, in fact, to expect in one individual team member.
*The Turing Way* is a handbook to support students, their supervisors, funders and journal editors in ensuring that reproducible research is "too easy not to do".
It includes training material on version control, analysis testing, collaborating in distributed groups, open and transparent communication skills, and effective management of diverse research projects.
*The Turing Way* is openly developed and any and all questions, comments and recommendations are welcome at our github repository: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way.
In this talk, Kirstie Whitaker, lead developer of *The Turing Way*, will take you on a whirlwind tour of the chapters that already exist, the interactive demonstrations you can use and re-use for your own research, and the directions in which we're continuing to develop.
All participants will leave the talk knowing that "Every Little Helps" when making their work reproducible, where to ask for help as they start or continue their open research journey, and how they can contribute to improve *The Turing Way* for future readers.

**Bio**: Kirstie Whitaker is a research fellow at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) (London, UK) and senior research associate in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge.
Her work covers a broad range of interests and methods, but the driving principle is to improve the lives of neurodivergent people and people with mental health conditions.
Dr Whitaker uses magnetic resonance imaging to study child and adolescent brain development and participatory citizen science to educate non-autistic people about how they can better support autistic friends and colleagues.
She is the lead developer of [*The Turing Way*](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way), an openly developed educational resource to enable more reproducible data science.
Kirstie is a passionate advocate for making science "open for all" by promoting equity and inclusion for people from diverse backgrounds, and by changing the academic incentive structure to reward collaborative working.
She is the chair of the Turing Institute's Ethics Advisory Group, a Fulbright scholarship alumna and was a 2016/17 [Mozilla Fellow for Science](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/fellowships/fellows).
Kirstie was named, with her collaborator Petra Vertes, as a [2016 Global Thinker](https://gt.foreignpolicy.com/2016/profile/petra-vertes-and-kirstie-whitaker) by Foreign Policy magazine.

### Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society

**Website**:

**Date**: 30 March 2020

**Title**: There are no adults: My journey to realising that no one has a plan!

**Abstract**: From the outside I'm an accomplished scientist:
I build websites, write code, and study how brain networks change over time.
But it doesn't feel that way to me.
It feels like I'm still "making it up as I go along".
In this talk, I'll bring you behind the curtain: a masters degree focused mainly on skiing rather than learning how MRI machines work, a PhD with a lot of cycling in the California sunshine.
And I'll reassure you that your uncertainty is both common and beneficial.
It is through exploring the world, and the many options that the future holds, that we can achieve our wildest dreams.

**Bio**: Kirstie Whitaker is a research fellow at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) (London, UK) and a senior research associate in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge.
After leaving Withington Girls' School in 2001 she was awarded a BSc with first class honours in Physics from the University of Bristol and then an MSc in Medical Physics from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.
She completed her PhD in Neuroscience at the University of California, Berkeley in 2012 and her postdoctoral work was conducted in the Brain Mapping Unit at the University of Cambridge from 2012 to 2017.
Her work covers a broad range of interests and methods, but the driving principle is to improve the lives of people with mental health disorders.
