**Date**: 5 - 10 January 2020

**Title**: The Turing Way: Transforming Research with Collaborative Working

**Abstract**:

**Bio**: Kirstie Whitaker is a research fellow at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) (London, UK) and senior research associate in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge.
Her work covers a broad range of interests and methods, but the driving principle is to improve the lives of neurodivergent people and people with mental health conditions.
Dr Whitaker uses magnetic resonance imaging to study child and adolescent brain development and participatory citizen science to educate non-autistic people about how they can better support autistic friends and colleagues.
She is the lead developer of [*The Turing Way*](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way), an openly developed educational resource to enable more reproducible data science.
Kirstie is a passionate advocate for making science "open for all" by promoting equity and inclusion for people from diverse backgrounds, and by changing the academic incentive structure to reward collaborative working.
She is the chair of the Turing Institute's Ethics Advisory Group, a Fulbright scholarship alumna and was a 2016/17 [Mozilla Fellow for Science](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/fellowships/fellows).
Kirstie was named, with her collaborator Petra Vertes, as a [2016 Global Thinker](https://gt.foreignpolicy.com/2016/profile/petra-vertes-and-kirstie-whitaker) by Foreign Policy magazine.

### OpenMR Benelux 2020

**Website**: https://openmrbenelux.github.io/page-openmrb-2020

**Date**: 21 January 2019

**Title**: The Turing Way: Reproducible, Inclusive, Collaborative Data Science

**Abstract**: Reproducible research is necessary to ensure that scientific work can be trusted.
By sharing data, analysis code and the computational environment used to generate the results, researchers can more effectively stand on the shoulders of their peers and colleagues and deliver high quality, trustworthy and verifiable outputs.
This requires skills in data management, library sciences, software development, and continuous integration techniques: skills that are not widely taught or expected of academic researchers.
Skills that are unreasonable, in fact, to expect in one individual team member.
*The Turing Way* is a handbook to support students, their supervisors, funders and journal editors in ensuring that reproducible research is "too easy not to do".
It includes training material on version control, analysis testing, collaborating in distributed groups, open and transparent communication skills, and effective management of diverse research projects.
*The Turing Way* is openly developed and any and all questions, comments and recommendations are welcome at our github repository: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way.
In this talk, Kirstie Whitaker, lead developer of *The Turing Way*, will take you on a whirlwind tour of the chapters that already exist, the interactive demonstrations you can use and re-use for your own research, and the directions in which we're continuing to develop.
All participants will leave the talk knowing that "Every Little Helps" when making their work reproducible, where to ask for help as they start or continue their open research journey, and how they can contribute to improve *The Turing Way* for future readers.

### Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society

**Website**:

**Date**: 30 March 2020

**Title**: There are no adults: My journey to realising that no one has a plan!

**Abstract**: From the outside I'm an accomplished scientist:
I build websites, write code, and study how brain networks change over time.
But it doesn't feel that way to me.
It feels like I'm still "making it up as I go along".
In this talk, I'll bring you behind the curtain: a masters degree focused mainly on skiing rather than learning how MRI machines work, a PhD with a lot of cycling in the California sunshine.
And I'll reassure you that your uncertainty is both common and beneficial.
It is through exploring the world, and the many options that the future holds, that we can achieve our wildest dreams.

**Bio**: Kirstie Whitaker is a research fellow at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) (London, UK) and a senior research associate in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge.
After leaving Withington Girls' School in 2001 she was awarded a BSc with first class honours in Physics from the University of Bristol and then an MSc in Medical Physics from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.
She completed her PhD in Neuroscience at the University of California, Berkeley in 2012 and her postdoctoral work was conducted in the Brain Mapping Unit at the University of Cambridge from 2012 to 2017.
Her work covers a broad range of interests and methods, but the driving principle is to improve the lives of people with mental health disorders.

### CogX

**Website**: https://cogx.co

**Date**: 8 - 10 June 2020

**Title**: Embedding our values in tools, practices and systems

**Abstract**:
_Please give a brief description of your talk (max 500 words)._
_The evaluation criteria of proposals will be:_

- _Expected general interest of the talk_
- _Academic standard and global impact_
- _Breadth of domain application_

All members of the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national institute for data science and artificial intelligence, are guided by the Turing's "Rules of the Game".
There are six dimensions of these recommendations for supportive interactions: trust, transparency, inclusivity, integrity, respect, and leadership.
In this talk, I describe how the Turing's Tools, Practices and Systems (TPS) Programme empowers humans to embed these values into our ways of working, and the open source software and infrastructure we build and maintain.

The TPS programme builds trustworthy systems.
Our safe haven infrastructure is deployed around the UK.
This secure research environment gives data scientists the scale and power of the cloud to predict personalised outcomes without sacrificing the privacy of people represented in the dataset.
Innovation in the digital humanities and insights into the healthcare system rely on the carefully developed processes that surround this infrastructure.

We train and mentor researchers and practitioners to transparently communicate their insights.
The Turing Way guide for reproducible research is used around the world to ensure that published results can be interrogated and extended with ease.
Toolboxes like sktime welcome and include more expertise in the data science ecosystem.
Their use of standard frameworks make analyses of time series data in economic forecasting and industrial sensor readings accessible to a broad community of practitioners.

The Turing's Ethics Advisory Group is supported through the Tools, Practices and Systems programme to implement guidance developed by social scientists and philosophers in the Public Policy programme.
We are responsible for maintaining the highest levels of integrity for all outputs generated by project teams.
Investigators are asked to consider the impact of their work - including indirect societal and individual harms - from the start and throughout their research.

We look to co-create solutions in a multidisciplinary and mutually respectful environment.
We are commmitted to demonstrating the creativity and transformative vision that can only be delivered by a diverse group of experts in a welcoming and collaborative space.
No one person can solve the challenges of climate change, inequality in access to social care, or online harms.
It is only by working together that we can use data science to change the world for the better.

All audience members are invited to share their expertise.
The TPS programme convenes national and international experts in open infrastructure.
We look to empower a decentralised network of the people who connect data with domain experts around the world.
Together we can break AI research out of domain specific siloes and democratise access to knowledge.
We will purposefully and thoughtfully embed our values into everthing we do.

_Please explain the relevance of your talk to the CogX audience, and the global impact of your research._
_500 words max._

CogX 2019 convened 20,000 visitors from government, third sector organisations, and businesses of all sizes.
They represented expertise in technology, finance, advertising, media, and energy and aerospace engineering.
All these audience members use open source tools and systems to leverage insights from data.
Their teams all have "pain points" at the boundaries of traditional expertise and will benefit from hearing about the Turing's efforts to connect and upskill research engineers to solve these challenges.

This talk will be relavent to attendees interested in the leadership, cutting edge, and ethics and society tracks.
The presentation will include examples of work deployed to accelerate insights into the acute treatment of COVID19 in a secure and responsible computational environment.
I will also describe how we can ensure that our tools, practices and systems are accountable to government and the tax payers that elect and fund them.
One of the core ethical practices that I will describe is the importance of co-design and co-creation of predictive models by and for a representative community of stakeholders.

There will be cross cutting interest for audience members interested in the next generation of infrastructure and cloud computing, cyber security, and the long view and transformative potential of research.
The examples of innovative, inclusive and collaborative ways of working will be of relavence to attendees of the "Start-up to Scale-Up to IPO and Beyond" track.

The talk will be accessible for all audiences, there will be no assumed knowledge or technological expertise required.

_Please let us know any other information you would like to share to support your application._

Tools, Practices and Systems is a new programme at the Turing Institute and I'm very keen to let the CogX community know about it.
I'm happy to adapt the talk proposal if there is a direction that would contribute to a more cohesive programme.
