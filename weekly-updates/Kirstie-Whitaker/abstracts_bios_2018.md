### Science on Screen: The Imitation Game

**Website**: https://www.crick.ac.uk/whats-on/upcoming-events/2018/01/10/science-on-screen-the-imitation-game/

**Date**: 10th January 2018

**Bio**: Dr Whitaker is a Research Fellow at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) and senior research associate in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge. She uses magnetic resonance imaging to study child and adolescent brain development. She is a Fulbright scholarship alumna, a 2016/17 [Mozilla Fellow for Science](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/fellowships/fellows) and in June will ride for the tenth time in the [AIDS/Lifecycle](http://www.tofighthiv.org/goto/kirstie) bike ride - 545 miles from San Francisco to LA to raise money to fight HIV/AIDS and eliminate the stigma associated with the virus. Kirstie is a passionate advocate for diversity in academia and tech, including support for LGBTQ+ members of our community.

### Role in data study group

**Role**: Dr Kirstie Whitaker focuses on participant engagement within the data study group. The whole team believes strongly in the power of collaborative working and Dr Whitaker is a particularly passionate advocate for increased diversity in data science. During the data study group week she acts as a meta-facilitator - a facilitator of the facilitators - and provides training and support for the PhD students who take on the task of project managing a team from a wide range of backgrounds and skills. She was a 2016 Mozilla Fellow for Science, one of just four awarded that year worldwide, and has spoken internationally on how to make science and technology development more equitable. A key contribution that Dr Whitaker brought to the DSG team was a clearly defined code of conduct that made explicit the data study group's focus on inclusivity and making sure there is space at the Alan Turing Institute for all participants to contribute their best work. She has supported the writing and delivery of high quality reports that clearly detail all the research conducted during the DSG week.

### Invited talk at CUBRIC

**Date**: 29th March 2018

**Title**: Structural brain development during adolescence and its relation to psychiatric disorders

**Abstract**: Adolescence is a period of human brain growth and high incidence of mental health disorders. I will present my work within the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network (NSPN; www.nspn.org.uk) on cortical myelination between the ages of 14 and 24. I will show, consistently in two cohorts, that age-related changes in adolescence are concentrated on the more densely connected hubs of the human structural connectome. I will demonstrate the power of integrating open data sets such as the Allen Brain Atlas with non-invasive imaging techniques: specifically by linking the expression of schizophrenia risk genes to adolescent brain development.

### Reusing Public Neuroimaging Datasets (an OHBM Educational Course)

**Website**: https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/files/2018/ED/Reusing%20Public%20Neuroimaging%20Datasets.pdf

**Date**: 17 June 2018

**Title**: The devil is in the details: accessing phenotypic data for brain-behaviour relationships

**Abstract**: Open neuroimaging datasets are fantastic resources for the community to develop new methods and validate existing analysis pipelines. But when the brain images are accompanied by additional information about the individuals in the dataset, we enter the world of population neuroscience (Paus, 2010), of being able to link deep imaging phenotypes to individual measures of behaviour over time (Poldrack et al, 2015), or of linking in vivo brain measures to posthumous measures of gene expression (Whitaker et al, 2016; Vertes et al, 2016). This section of the course will focus on understanding the increased privacy and ethical requirements for sharing phenotypic data. Planning a study that uses “other people’s data” is often not a free lunch; in particular each individual study will store data in slightly different ways and there is high variability in how easy these information are to access and re-use. We’ll discuss the importance of finding metadata to accompany the data itself, and of maintaining a healthy skepticism of data you did not collect yourself. We will also brainstorm - using an interactive slido voting poll - ways in which users can feedback errors or the location of missing information to the owners of the dataset to ensure that bugs are caught and the documentation improved. The end will be a call for participatory collaborative research, encouraging users to become contributors to the excellent shared resources so that everyone in the field of neuroimaging benefits from their existence.

### Turing Interns: git and GitHub training

**Website**: https://kirstiejane.github.io/friendly-github-intro

**Date**: 6 July 2018

**Title**: Collaborative Working with Git and GitHub

**Abstract**: As part of your internship we have organised a session on reproducible research from 10:00am -12:00pm this Friday. It will take place on the second floor and will be run by Kirstie Whitaker, a Research Fellow here at the Turing. The session will discuss broadly why reproducible research is important, but also focus on GitHub, a free and open source platform that can help you build projects that are collaborative, well documented, and version-controlled. These are all attributes of a very successful Data Science summer enterprise!

 Kirstie will introduce you to the GitHub ecosystem, explain the common (and somewhat jargon-y) terms, and outline a couple of basic GitHub workflows. Some of you will know this already, for others it will be very new. During the 2 hour workshop you will work together to learn from each other how to navigate the Alan Turing Institute organisation and submit and merge a pull request. We will discuss the importance of collaborative and reproducible working, and set you up for success during your internship. This is fantastic opportunity for you to discover a new way to manage research and, even for those of you already familiar with GitHub, is something that will benefit you moving forward in your careers.
