### CamBRAIN NeuroTalks

**Website**: https://cambrainsociety.com/events-2/cambrain-events/

**Date**: 1st February 2017

**Title**: Checking your working: a reproducible and replicable neuroimaging study of adolescent brain development.

**Abstract**: Adolescence is a period of human brain growth and high incidence of mental health disorders. In 2016 the [Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network](http://www.nspn.org.uk/) published a study of adolescent brain development which showed that the hubs of the structural connectome are late developing and are found in association cortex (http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1601745113). Furthermore these regions are enriched for genes related to schizophrenia. In this presentation Dr Kirstie Whitaker will demonstrate how this work is supported by open data and analysis code, and that the results replicate in two independent cohorts of teenagers. She will encourage CamBRAIN members to take steps towards ensuring that their work meets these standards for open and reproducible science in 2017 and beyond.

**Dates**: 9th & 10th March, 2017

**Title**: Longitudinal neuroimaging in UCHANGE: processing update and preliminary results

**Abstract**: Of the 300 participants who completed MRI scans as members of the UCHANGE study, 230 of them have returned for an additional MRI around one year later. In this talk, I will describe the processing pipeline for this data, including the quality control steps for the surface based reconstructions, and the demographics of the participants make up the longitudinal dataset. I will show that the cross-sectional results showing regional variation in the amount of age-related change in cortical thickness and magnetisation transfer (Whitaker\*, VÃ©rtes\* et al, 2016) are also present when within-person change is considered. My talk will conclude by describing planned analyses with Dr Simon White using mixed-models to understand the variation in brain structure across and within participants.

**Press release**:
Adolescence is a period of human brain growth and high incidence of mental health disorders. In my talk I will discuss recent work by the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network: a collaboration between the University of Cambridge and University College London which seeks to better understand adolescent development in brain and behaviour. I will describe the different types of magnetic resonance images we acquire to better understand changes in the brainâs structure and function. I will also explain our use of graph theory for brain network analysis. The different parts of the brain do not work alone, they are connected to each other and send messages back and forth in order to generate complex thoughts and social interactions. The particularly well connected regions - the hubs of the network - continue to develop throughout the teenage years, and this may be a mechanism to explain the emergence of mental health disorders during the teenage years.

### Endocrine Society


**Website**: www.endocrine.org/meetings/endo-annual-meetings

**Date**: 3rd April 2017

**Title**: Making Connections in the Adolescent Brain

**Abstract**: Adolescence is a period of human brain growth and high incidence of mental health disorders. I will present findings that adolescent cortical myelination and shrinkage are coupled and specifically associated with a dorsoventrally patterned gene expression profile enriched for synaptic, oligodendroglial- and schizophrenia-related genes. The topologically efficient and biologically expensive hubs of the brain anatomical network are located in association cortical regions and have the most pronounced changes during adolescence.

### Invited talk at University of Pennsylvania

**Date**: 20th April 2017

**Title**: Structural brain development during adolescence and its relation to psychiatric disorders

**Abstract**: Adolescence is a period of human brain growth and high incidence of mental health disorders. I will present my work within the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network (NSPN; www.nspn.org.uk) on cortical myelination between the ages of 14 and 24. I will show, consistently in two cohorts, that age-related changes in adolescence are concentrated on the more densely connected hubs of the human structural connectome. I will demonstrate the power of integrating open data sets such as the Allen Brain Atlas with non-invasive imaging techniques: specifically by linking the expression of schizophrenia risk genes to adolescent brain development.

### Society of Biological Psychiatry

**Website**: https://sobp.societyconference.com/conf_website/c29icC5zb2NpZXR5Y29uZmVyZ

**Date**: 18th - 20th May 2017

**Title**: Adolescence is associated with genomically patterned consolidation of the hubs of the human brain connectome

**Abstract**:

BACKGROUND
Adolescence is a period of human brain growth and high incidence of mental health disorders. The Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network (http://nspn.org.uk) seeks to understand biological underpinnings of the adolescent risk of depression and schizophrenia.

METHODS
Multi-parametric mapping magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure cortical thickness and intracortical myelination in 297 population volunteers aged 14â24 years old. Regional measures at 308 locations across cortex were combined into a structural covariance network and calculated topological measures of degree and closeness centrality extracted. We related nodal measures to regional gene transcriptome data provided by the Allen Institute for Brain Science (http://human.brain-map.org). All statistical analyses were conducted using permutation tests with significance set at P < .05 after correction for multiple comparisons.

RESULTS
We found that association cortical areas were thicker and less myelinated than primary cortical areas at 14 years. However, association cortex had faster rates of shrinkage and myelination over the course of adolescence. Adolescent cortical myelination and shrinkage were coupled and specifically associated with a dorsoventrally patterned gene expression profile enriched for synaptic, oligodendroglial- and schizophrenia-related genes. Topologically efficient and biologically expensive hubs of the brain anatomical network had greater rates of shrinkage/myelination and were associated with overexpression of the same transcriptional profile as cortical consolidation. All results replicated in two independent cohorts.

CONCLUSIONS
We conclude that normative human brain maturation involves a genetically patterned process of consolidating anatomical network hubs. We argue that developmental variation of this consolidation process may be relevant both to normal cognitive and behavioral changes and the high incidence of schizophrenia during human brain adolescence.

### Talk at Poldrack lab meeting

**Date**: 31st May 2017

**Title**: The logistical and emotional challenges of replicating published work

**Abstract**: Encouraging reproducible research - the sharing of data and code along with published findings - opens up the possibility of investigating how well a finding replicates in independent cohorts. It may not be easy to reproduce what someone has done (their code often is not well documented for example) but I have confidence that the open science community can help on the analysis front. A more challenging frontier is the application of a definition of replication - if the "blob" is in a slightly different location what do we conclude? Finally, however, the hardest challenge may be in dealing with the push-back from the original authors who could perceive "failed replications" as a personal attack. During my allocated time at lab meeting I will present a project proposal to replicate neuroimaging findings, explain the motivations and set up what I see are the major challenges. I hope to stimulate a discussion about the future of publishing replication studies in the era of big, and open, data.

It was a really slow starter, there were a few months at the beginning where it was just me and one other person who came along to discuss the book/movie, but it's grown over the last 4 years into something I'm really proud of. The best stories we've discussed (that come to mind as I write this) were The Hours, Half of a Yellow Sun, and In Cold Blood.

### European College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ENCP) Congress

**Website**: http://2017.ecnp.eu

**Date**: 5th September 2017

**Title**: Intra-cortical myelination during adolescence: linking MRI networks with gene transcription profiles

**Abstract**: Adolescence is a period of human brain growth and high incidence of mental health disorders. The Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network (http://nspn.org.uk) seeks to understand biological underpinnings of the adolescent risk of depression and schizophrenia. In this talk I will present findings using multi-parametric mapping magnetic resonance imaging to measure cortical thickness and intra-cortical myelination in 297 population volunteers aged 14â24 years old [1]. Regional measures at 308 locations across cortex were combined into a structural covariance network and we calculated and extracted topological measures of degree and closeness centrality extracted. All nodal measures were then related to regional gene transcriptome data provided by the Allen Institute for Brain Science (http://human.brain-map.org). We found that association cortical areas were thicker and less myelinated than primary cortical areas at 14 years, but that association cortex had faster rates of shrinkage and myelination over the course of adolescence. Adolescent cortical myelination and shrinkage were coupled and specifically associated with a dorsoventrally patterned gene expression profile enriched for synaptic, oligodendroglial- and schizophrenia-related genes. Topologically efficient and biologically expensive hubs of the brain anatomical network had greater rates of myelination and were associated with overexpression of the same transcriptional profile as cortical consolidation. All results replicated in two independent cohorts. This work demonstrates that measurements of myelin can be linked across the micro and macro scales to better understand typical and atypical adolescent brain development.

**Title**: Reproducibility at the Turing

**Summary**: Reproducibility ensures that the wider academic, industry and governmental communities we operate in can easily validate, replicate and build on the work we produce. This session will empower you - the people actually doing the analyses - to position the Turing Institute as a world leader in reproducible research. We will start by defining "reproducible research" and "open science" (and discuss the difference between those two). We will introduce you to the Alan Turing Institute organisation on GitHub and give a very brief overview of the benefits of the platform for version control and collaborative working. You will leave having completed your first pull request and knowing who to ask when you have questions about reproducibility at the Turing.

**Equipment**: Laptop

**Recording**: Livestream during the lecture parts, recording for use in-house only during the discussions.

**Layout**: Cabaret with tables

**Equipment required**: Whiteboard, postit notes and pens.

Kirstie Whitaker is a Research Fellow at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) (London, UK). She completed her PhD in Neuroscience at the University of California, Berkeley in 2012 and holds a BSc in Physics from the University of Bristol and an MSc in Medical Physics from the University of British Columbia. She joined the Department of Psychiatry in 2012 and conducted her postdoctoral research in the Brain Mapping Unit under the supervision of Professor Ed Bullmore.  She remains a member of the department as a senior research associate.

Dr Whitaker uses magnetic resonance images to understand the changes in the brain's structure and function that underlie the emergence of schizophrenia and depression. Her work has shown that changes in myelin content in the brain's "grey matter" increase through adolescence and that association cortex - the area of the brain that underpins complex cognition such as reasoning - continues to develop into your 20s and beyond.

Kirstie is particularly passionate about ensuring that work is reproducible and can be replicated in independent data sets. She is committed to supporting early career researchers ensure they can share their data and code while also following strict ethical guidelines. As a researcher at the Turing Institute Dr Whitaker focuses on how data science techniques can improve neuroimaging analyses, including the application of machine learning techniques to big data sets such as UK Biobank.

Dr Whitaker is a Fulbright scholarship alumna and was a 2016/17 [Mozilla Fellow for Science](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/fellowships/fellows). She will be the chair of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping's Open Science special interest group in 2019 and is currently serving as chair-elect. Kirstie was named, with her collaborator Petra Vertes, as a [2016 Global Thinker](https://gt.foreignpolicy.com/2016/profile/petra-vertes-and-kirstie-whitaker) by Foreign Policy magazine.

### International Conference on Human Brain Development

**Website**: http://ichbd2017.csp.escience.cn/dct/page/1

**Date**: 10th-15th October 2017

**Title**: Making Connections in the Adolescent Brain

**Abstract**: Adolescence is a period of human brain growth and high incidence of mental health disorders. I will present work by the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network (NSPN; www.nspn.org.uk) on cortical myelination between the ages of 14 and 24. I will show, consistently in two cohorts, that age-related changes in adolescence are concentrated on the more densely connected hubs of the human structural connectome. These regions tend to be found in association cortex. I will demonstrate the power of integrating open data sets such as the Allen Brain Atlas with non-invasive imaging techniques. We found that the brain regions that change the most at this (late) stage of child brain development are enriched for genes linked to synapses and oligodendrocytes, and for genes associated with a risk of schizophrenia.

### Brainhack Warsaw

**Website**: https://brainhackwarsaw.github.io

**Date**: 19th November

**Title**: Shooting for the stars: Moving from reproducible to open research

**Abstract**: This talk will discuss the perceived and actual barriers experienced by researchers attempting to do reproducible research in neuroscience, and give practical guidance on how they can be overcome. It will include suggestions on how to make your code and data available and usable for others (including a strong suggestion to document both clearly so you don't have to reply to lots of email questions from future users). However, as this is a Brainhack event, Dr Whitaker will push you further: to consider working openly. Open research is an important step in changing an academic reward system from its current focus on individual contributions and "getting there first" to sharing work as it is being created and allowing collaborators to contribute from the start. All Brainhack Warsaw participants will leave knowing there is something they can do to step towards making their research reproducible, and hopefully a few will be inspired to make more radical changes.
