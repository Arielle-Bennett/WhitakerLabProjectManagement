## Date: 8 January 2021

### What brought you joy this week?

* I had a phone conversation with JH about Phoenix plans that I got really jazzed about.
  But more importantly it was just lovely to get a bit of mentorship & allyship from a friend.
* Movement forwards with connecting Raphtory with an industry team who are using their code!!
* Really exciting meetings with co-is and collaborators on the big grant (deadline 12 Jan).
  I'm feeling very inspired! :sparkling_heart:
* Not joy exactly but a feeling of purpose - I had a conversation with someone going through a tough time, listened and gave advice.
  Most importantly, I said "I believe you" which I think meant more than anything else I could have said or done.
* Lab meeting was a beautiful moment of holding space for each other around the news of the attempted coup in the USA and sharing some of our personal challenges and needs for 2021.
  In particular I was proud that I shared what my needs were and how the members of the lab can help me.
* The snow on Friday was just glorious.
  So incredibly beautiful.
* I loved drawing a network with networkx!!
  I still got it!
  * Even made some [accidental art](https://twitter.com/kirstie_j/status/1347139895161196556?s=20)
* No meeting Friday was the freaking BOMB!
* Co-working on [Year Compass](https://yearcompass.com/#download) with the CS&S team was wonderful.

### What did you achieve?

* Knowledge share seminar and strategic planning with HM and CH.
  * Set a few plans in motion for Project :fire::bird:
* Recruitment process for community manager support.
* Clarity on what we're trying to do for the big grant.
  Both internally and externally it seems like we're in a really powerful position. 
  * Not always easy, but the work I did in the run up was very well aligned.
* Really fun brainstorming on TPS leadership plans.
* Useful (I hope!) feedback on EAG application.
* Worked out every day.

### What did you struggle with?

* I haven't set my calendar up the way I had hoped I would.
  I still need to get a LOT of 1:1 meetings in there.
* I didn't get job descriptions written.
  * I think I'm super blocked on those.
    I should probably chat with AL & get some input.

### Any other topics

Ah, I really hope I can keep this up :crossed_fingers:
