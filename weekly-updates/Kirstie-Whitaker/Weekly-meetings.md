    You're doing great 💗
* Turing Way newsletter! OMG so great!
  * https://tinyletter.com/TuringWay/letters/new-year-wishes-from-the-turing-way-and-plans-for-2021

  * As. Always.
* TPS Seminar!!
  And I didn't do anything for it!
  Thank you AB!!

  I'm so delighted.
  (And that's not including Arielle and me 😆)
* Our panel members at the TPS Showcase were great examples of our lovely community!
* Really appreciated how thoughtful the short listing conversation with SH and EM was.
* The members of the Turing EAG are such a delight 💞
* Wildly appreciative of EK for getting so much documentation tidied up 🙀💖
* Gave a job reference for someone to potentially get a really kick ass job.
  SUCH A JOY.
* Caught up with MOR - nice to have a bit of a chilled out chat.
* Biden inauguration.
  * Loved how mum and David decorated the house and had the champers going! 🥂
  * Poet Amanda Gorman was the stand out star: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/20/amanda-gorman-poem-biden-inauguration-transcript
* Not _joy_ exactly but I appreciated being listened to in a ranty rant at the end of the week!

  GOOD GRIEF did it have to take me that long to send an email?!?!

* Invited a couple of folks for the MTR next week!
* Zoomin in at 6pm on Friday - a BIDS Starter Kit meeting!
  Really nice to actually do something useful for brain imaging for the first time in ages 🧠

### What did you struggle with?

* Feeling like I get freaking conflicting instructions - how can people be more involved, oh but they can't actually _be involved_. 😠🤬
* Can't find speakers for a knowledge share.
  No one wants to share their knowledge :sob:
* DOODLES AAAAAAH.
  They seem like such a good idea.
  But actually, I hate them
  * (This is this week's Gantt chart commitment. No. More.)
* Still haven't got my calendar properly sorted out for the year.
  Missing a bunch of 1:1s... ☹️
* Attended one meeting that made every neuron fire all at once.
  * I tried.
    I'm not going to take part in that conversation again.
  * Put. The battle. Down. Kirstie.
* Missed my workouts from doing too many evening calls.
  And didn't leave the house often because it was raining so much 🌊
  Need to do better on exercise next week.

### Any other topics

Not much more to add.
Next week is going to be wild :scream_cat:

## Date: 15 January 2021

### What brought you joy this week?

* SUBMITTED THE GRANT! 🥂
  YEAAAAAAAH! 🎊🎊🎊
  * I don't think its perfect but I do think its pretty good.
  * I particularly want to acknowledge how much effort has gone into equity and inclusion and the representation of ECRs at decision making levels.
    I am SO HOPEFUL that this works out. 🤞😬🤞
  * I'm also proud of the email that I sent to say thank you to all the folks who made it happen.
    I often _mean_ to send those messages but I don't actually get them done.
* I made some good progress on working with the lab on how we can adapt the interactions to grow with my responsibilities.
  Some of those conversations weren't the easiest but I'm proud of myself for having them.
  * Lab meeting was good I think.
    I loved the answers around the definition of service.
  * I don't think I got across my needs as well as I had hoped I did.
    But at least the follow up conversations helped me to see that I hadn't and could clarify.
* Great long conversation with AM and SB.
  Linked because I walked the gated road with them both but on different days.
  Always a delight 🌻
* The TPS newsletter is SO COOL!
* HM led a project check in all by himself and I'm super proud & psyched 👾
* Not really joy but I did say thank you to someone who has been doing really tough work on behalf of the TPS programme.
  I'm glad I made the effort to say that.
* Fast streamer accepted!! WOOOOO!! :star2: :star2: :star2:
* Introducing EK to the project team 😻
* Being asked to write a letter endorsing the importance of open source work is PRETTY COOL.
  * Same for the recommendation letter!! 💖

### What did you achieve

* Submitted the grant.
  Made me joyful.
  See above 😜
* Planning for lab interactions / mentorship
  * And in particular some pretty nice networkx code to showcase selected interactions 😆
* Onboarded EK (well... mostly) and I am SO GRATEFUL for her being here! 🙏
* Fun ethics planning - event series and link up with someone looking for advice.
* Planning for RAM 🐏 positions.
  Really useful conversations.
* Training Steering Group meeting.
  * Not sure how much I _achieved_ but I did support & endorse really great work done by others 😅
* Grant feedback & planning call(s).
* I _HOPE_ I helped make a plan for coordinating with the Carpentries.
* Had to enforce a code of conduct violation.
  That was wild.
  But I think I did a good job 💜
* Prepped for TPS Showcase next week.
* WILDLY not my achievement but ARIELLE got the videos submitted for the ASG MTR and they are FAB!
* BIDS Steering Group meeting.
  * FREAKING SENT the authorship guidelines .... FINALLY 💪
* Checked in with one of the TPS projects.
  Pretty confident I was reassuring.
  Hopefully I also sparked a few ideas! :grin:
* Gave useful feedback on a postdoc application! 🤔
* Said hi to the Engage at Turing students a few times.
  Hopefully in a useful way!
* Prep meeting for ASG MTR.
* Submitted the letter of recommendation for Pangeo work.
* Endorsed GSOC applications for Autistica & Turing Way projects 🙌
  * They were really done by others!
  * Gave a bit of feedback on OLS project ideas too.
* Prepped giving a reference for someone.
  Wildly excited!

### What did you struggle with?

* I had a couple of tough conversations that I think are going to lead to me having to make some difficult decisions.
  I really hope that they landed ok and that it was for the good of all...
  * (One motivational, one to say no)
* I felt patronised a couple of times this week.
  I'm curious to reflect on whether that's _me_ perceiving something that isn't there... or whether its real.
  Going to try to have one follow up conversation to check in.
* I really really hope that I was motivating in one of my conversations and not just rambling and - potentially - being patronising back 😬
  * Note to self, need to check in with that person to find out.
* I LOVED my no-meeting Friday but I didn't reply to my emails / tasks, nor get this update done.
  * So I need to do a tiny bit more to stay on top of those.
  * Although, having said that, I did submit a pretty huge grant this week 😆
    Maybe I can be a bit more gentle with myself.
* HAHA - I can't believe I almost forgot this.
  **I will never be the person in charge of making a gantt chart ever again.**
  * That shit was not. my. jam. 🍯

### Any other topics

It's amazing how much I do when I actually write it all down 🙀

Had a chill weekend, two lovely walks.
Loads of cross stitchin.

## Date: 8 January 2021

### What brought you joy this week?

* I had a phone conversation with JH about Phoenix plans that I got really jazzed about.
  But more importantly it was just lovely to get a bit of mentorship & allyship from a friend.
* Movement forwards with connecting Raphtory with an industry team who are using their code!!
* Really exciting meetings with co-is and collaborators on the big grant (deadline 12 Jan).
  I'm feeling very inspired! :sparkling_heart:
* Not joy exactly but a feeling of purpose - I had a conversation with someone going through a tough time, listened and gave advice.
  Most importantly, I said "I believe you" which I think meant more than anything else I could have said or done.
* Lab meeting was a beautiful moment of holding space for each other around the news of the attempted coup in the USA and sharing some of our personal challenges and needs for 2021.
  In particular I was proud that I shared what my needs were and how the members of the lab can help me.
* The snow on Friday was just glorious.
  So incredibly beautiful.
* I loved drawing a network with networkx!!
  I still got it!
  * Even made some [accidental art](https://twitter.com/kirstie_j/status/1347139895161196556?s=20)
* No meeting Friday was the freaking BOMB!
* Co-working on [Year Compass](https://yearcompass.com/#download) with the CS&S team was wonderful.

### What did you achieve?

* Knowledge share seminar and strategic planning with HM and CH.
  * Set a few plans in motion for Project :fire::bird:
* Recruitment process for community manager support.
* Clarity on what we're trying to do for the big grant.
  Both internally and externally it seems like we're in a really powerful position.
  * Not always easy, but the work I did in the run up was very well aligned.
* Really fun brainstorming on TPS leadership plans.
* Useful (I hope!) feedback on EAG application.
* Worked out every day.

### What did you struggle with?

* I haven't set my calendar up the way I had hoped I would.
  I still need to get a LOT of 1:1 meetings in there.
* I didn't get job descriptions written.
  * I think I'm super blocked on those.
    I should probably chat with AL & get some input.

### Any other topics

Ah, I really hope I can keep this up :crossed_fingers:
