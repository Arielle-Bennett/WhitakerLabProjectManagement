## Research to empower: co-creating a acitizen-science platform


_Please give a brief description of your talk (max 500 words)._
_The evaluation criteria of proposals will be:_

- _Expected general interest of the talk_
- _Academic standard and global impact_
- _Breadth of domain application_

Open source development, citizen-science, and participatory science are three fields of rapidly expanding growth, opportunity, and debate. 
This talk will present recent findings from a research project occupying a unique point at their intersection. 

This project is currently developing a citizen-science platform which will be used to collect data on sensory processing and autism. 
Experiencing sensory processing differences compared to the wider population is a diagnostic criterium of autism – and its prevalence is supported by numerous lab-based studies. 
Yet there is a research gap in understanding how sensory processing affects autistic people in their daily lives as they navigate the world around them. 

This is a vital area of research, with the potential to help make spaces and environments such as workplaces, schools, hospitals and transport more accessible for autistic people in the short and long term. 
The data gathered can be used to create guidelines and strategies, as well as suggest areas for future research, in the service of longer, healthier, and happier lives for autistic people and their families. 
Furthermore, the research topic addresses two of the top priorities for autism research according to a 2016 James Lind priority-setting alliance. 

One of the most striking aspects of the project is its unique position spanning many different fields, sectors, and workflows. 
Organisational stakeholders include The Alan Turing Institute, the UK’s national institute for artificial intelligence and data science, and Autistica, a UK-based autism research charity, and The University of Cambridge. 
The research team is based at The Turing but are working across multiple sectors, with a development team provided pro bono by Autistica’s corporate partner, Fujitsu, a back-end infrastructure supported by The Open Humans Foundation, and volunteers from a wide range of backgrounds and organisations, including the UK government and the BBC.
Most importantly, both the research process and the platform itself are being collaboratively designed and co-directed by members of the autistic community. 

This talk will present a framework designed to underpin a community-led partnership combining academic, charitable, and corporate workflows, allowing them to be directed towards shared goals, governed by a shared understanding. 
It will propose how open source, citizen-science, and participatory science can be not only compatible with one another, but mutually supportive, both ethically and practically. 

It will showcase a new qualitative dataset derived from ongoing dialogue between researchers, developers, members of the autistic community, and those who are in multiple groups. 
Further, it will demonstrate concrete steps by which community discussion can be transformed into actionable user stories, addressed openly and transparently on GitHub, and used to develop the platform itself. 

Throughout, the talk will explore challenges and possibilities of distributed work, leadership and collective decision-making.

The result of the project will be a citizen-science platform which can be easily adapted to investigate other research questions, and a framework which can support other studies, on a potentially international scale. 
This talk will showcase insights, new data, and learning from the project as it unfolds. 

## Relevance

_Please explain the relevance of your talk to the CogX audience, and the global impact of your research._
_500 words max._

CogX brings together an audience interested in finding answers and solutions to the question, “How can we get the next 10 years right?”.

The last 10 years have shown us that to address this question we need a diverse community actively engaged in answering it. 
The combined expertise and experience from across different backgrounds, sectors, and fields is required, making CogX a globally important event. 
CogX draws an audience of people interested in finding new opportunities, learning from one another, and forming collaborations. 
By presenting a test case of collaboration across multiple fields and sectors in action, this talk will have direct relevance to CogX’s attendees and is in alignment with the mission of CogX.

The project this talk presents is a practical, collaborative implementation of steps addressing many of the most pressing issues revealed for AI in the past decade: problems of inclusion, socially-beneficial impact, and leadership which empowers.

This talk is relevant to autism researchers specifically and scientists more generally because it offers tools and workflows to support research to be more open, transparent, and reproducible. 
It also gives a test case of participatory research in practise, providing insights into diverse community engagement at different stages of the research process.

It will be of interest to policy-makers, employers, and educators, as one of the goals of the project is to produce a dataset which can be used to directly inform policy on the built environment - including public spaces, workplaces, and schools. 
Further, there will be opportunity to collaborate at this stage of the project in guiding its development. 

In AI research, improvements in diversity and inclusion are of urgent importance if we are to get the next 10 years right. 
Diversity and inclusion is vital in every sector, industry, and field. 
Yet true inclusivity cannot be simply a tick-box exercise. 
To be effective, diverse populations must be in empowered positions of direction-setting and decision-making. 
This talk will address some of the practical steps for adapting conventional research processes and agile development methods so that they are more genuinely inclusive of diverse groups, including neurodiverse populations. 

This project is open to all. 
Our datasets, platform design, and process documentation are publicly available at our GitHub repository. 
They can be used and adapted by anyone for any purpose, as long as they credit the community. CogX sttendees from all backgrounds will be invited to explore our work and to collaborate with us.  

## _Please let us know any other information you would like to share to support your application_

This creation and delivery of this talk will itself model the participatory methods it proposes. The talk will be co-designed, edited, and reviewed by autistic collaborators as well as members of the core research team. It will also be published openly and circulated to the community.
