# Weekly updates

This folder contains records from all lab members - including Kirstie when she doesn't get overwhelmed and forget - to recognise and monitor the progression of their work.

The guidelines can be found in the lab Onboarding repository: [Setting-up-your-weekly-meetings.md](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/Onboarding/blob/lab-meetings/Setting-up-your-weekly-meetings.md).

Records from alumni are in the [alumni](alumni) folder.
