### Date: 19 May 2020

#### Who did you help this week?

* I helped DSG with that one research project where the ethics form had been stalled for a couple of months (CH helped too, of course!)
  
#### Who helped you this week?

* MS helped me create a template for the Turing Way
* CH gave lots of feedback on the ethics form

#### What did you achieve?

* I got the ethics form to a place where I was willing to share with you! Also created a new template for "editors" on The Turing Way! (https://github.com/Ismael-KG/the-turing-way/blob/patch-1/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/EDITOR_ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)

#### What did you struggle with?

* Reviewing the ethics form seemed to be taking forever!

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Prepare agenda for EAG meeting on 10-June, start reviweing form's guidelines document (one chunk relies on having the form on Flexi-Grant first for screenshots)

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Guidance on new ethics approval form

#### Any other topics

* Working times? Maybe I can do an four days?

### Date: 19 May 2020

#### Who did you help this week?

* I helped MS by creating a screenshot for their contribution-hackMD (not much to it, haha).
* Also went step by step thanks to GA to test out a new bot, which unfortunately didn't work :anguished:
  * KW: THANK YOU! And it's now fixed!! GO GO ROBOT :robot:
  
#### Who helped you this week?

* JR and JM got me on the developer site of the safe haven!
* CH helped build a roadmap for the new EAG form.
* Oh, and AR helped once again with Flexi-Grant!
* (Update: GA helped me edit this on GitHub after I commited with a typo!)

KW: YAAAAY - so helpful - everyone's the best! :heart_eyes:

#### What did you achieve?

* To be honest, I want to say I got the EAG chat going really nicely (although your news to LC probably got her excited too, which helped immensely!)
* Flexi-Grant finally does the job right! SO MANY OPTIONS TO TOGGLE.

KW: These are fantastic achievements! Great work!

#### What did you struggle with?

* A bit with understanding how the safe haven will fit with the EAG process -- I feel the integration, whatever it looks like, will be more long-term

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Finalise new EAG form; maybe content for EAG video?
* KW: Start thinking about guidance? To go with the form & to be featured in the video :joy: 
* KW: Connect with safe haven folks about building either a public form separated from the data, or translating the classification questions into flexigrant

KW: Generally I think this is a good week to probably consolidate some of the information that you've been gathering over the last month. All going in a great direction though!

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Data Safe Haven! (In general terms)
  * KW: Thank you so much for demoing this!!

#### Any other topics

* Not this week!

* The training wheels are coming off and I think I just need general reassurance =)
  * KW: AS ABOVE. GREAT WORK.

#### Any other topics

My dissertation topic (it had to come up explicitly eventually, haha): how do cultural shifts happen in scientific communities. Is this the question you had in mind? (nb: 10,000 words limit!)
