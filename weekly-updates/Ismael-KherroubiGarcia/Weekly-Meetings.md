### Date: 29 July 2020

#### Who did you help this week?

* Over the past week, I helped the DSSG folks with the ethical research workshop!
* I also helped PH (I think!) by doing some DMPOnline testing

#### Who helped you this week?

* You saved the day by making a Zoom room that worked for the DSSG training!

#### What did you achieve?

* The DSSG ethics training was a big thing for me!

#### What did you struggle with?

* Suddenly, we got three EAG forms over the weekend and I think the reviewers are at capacity. Also, there are the summer holidays, so this might be a larger struggle.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Chatting with MF and MN on Thursday about delivering more training. I think I like the idea of working on that some more!
* I'm also giving the EAG folders and excel document a review for tidiness!

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Who could I work with on writing a post for the Turing blog about research ethics? I guess the thesis of that blog would be: ethical reflection is critical to the scientific method. But I'd love to bounce ideas around.

#### Any other topics

* None at the moment!

### Date: 17 June 2020

#### Who did you help this week?

* I helped MS word the new Ethics intro page for The Turing Way: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/jupyterbook-restructure/book/website/ethical-research/ethical-research.md
  * KW: YEAH!

#### Who helped you this week?

* MS and LC helped me write the blog post for Data Feminism! (And the authors had a look too, which is awesome!)
  * KW: SO FREAKING COOL! :hibiscus: :muscle:
  * Just a couple of notes about the start and finish - really tiny changes - the whole post reads really well - well done! :sparkles:

#### What did you achieve?

* We got one of the two DSSG forms approved (the first I have owned from start to finish!)
  * KW: YAAAAY!
* Hosted first EAG meeting, lovely to meet everyone
  * KW: And wrote up the minutes etc!
* Developed training for DSSG
* Got some feedback on application form from EAG members
* Wrote Data Feminism blog post

#### What did you struggle with?

* Long story, something about a poorly worded survey question (not to do with work)
  * KW: Solidarity. Sounds like a super stressful week.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* I am seeing different standards in ethics reviews -- or at least varying degrees of specificity in what is required from applicants... With my customer service and administrator hats on, I feel guidance must be made available to reviewers, so that expectations are clear... Can I work on setting this idea?
  * YES PLEASE :heart_eyes:

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* It would be great to hear back on the ethics form and the integration of the Safe Haven questions
  * KW: SOB - I'm so sorry I'm so slow. YES. I will do this.

#### Any other topics

* Hopefully buying an office chair shortly! I'm on Gray Dawes now!
  * :moneybag::moneybag::moneybag: :wink:

  * KW: Great stuff!

#### Who helped you this week?

* MS helped me create a template for the Turing Way
  * KW: Ah - this also counts as helping the Turing Way! Glad MS could help too :sparkles:
* CH gave lots of feedback on the ethics form
  * KW: Fab

#### What did you achieve?

* I got the ethics form to a place where I was willing to share with you!
  * KW: :heart_eyes::heart_eyes::heart_eyes:

  * KW: SO COOL!

#### What did you struggle with?

* Reviewing the ethics form seemed to be taking forever!

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Prepare agenda for EAG meeting on 10-June, start reviweing form's guidelines document (one chunk relies on having the form on Flexi-Grant first for screenshots)

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Guidance on new ethics approval form
  * KW: Thank you so much for putting so much thought into this form! Love it!

#### Any other topics

* Working times? Maybe I can do an four days?

Really great work - I'm delighted with the form - one more pass and then I think we're ready to socialise! Thank you !

KW: YAAAAY - so helpful - everyone's the best! :heart_eyes:

#### What did you achieve?

* To be honest, I want to say I got the EAG chat going really nicely (although your news to LC probably got her excited too, which helped immensely!)
* Flexi-Grant finally does the job right! SO MANY OPTIONS TO TOGGLE.

KW: These are fantastic achievements! Great work!

#### What did you struggle with?

* A bit with understanding how the safe haven will fit with the EAG process -- I feel the integration, whatever it looks like, will be more long-term

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Finalise new EAG form; maybe content for EAG video?
* KW: Start thinking about guidance? To go with the form & to be featured in the video :joy: 
* KW: Connect with safe haven folks about building either a public form separated from the data, or translating the classification questions into flexigrant

KW: Generally I think this is a good week to probably consolidate some of the information that you've been gathering over the last month. All going in a great direction though!

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Data Safe Haven! (In general terms)
  * KW: Thank you so much for demoing this!!

#### Any other topics

* Not this week!

* The training wheels are coming off and I think I just need general reassurance =)
  * KW: AS ABOVE. GREAT WORK.

#### Any other topics

My dissertation topic (it had to come up explicitly eventually, haha): how do cultural shifts happen in scientific communities. Is this the question you had in mind? (nb: 10,000 words limit!)
