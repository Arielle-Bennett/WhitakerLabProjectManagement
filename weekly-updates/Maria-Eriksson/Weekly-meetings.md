#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Introduction to Markus Löning
* Invitation to DECOVID meetings

#### Any other topics

* Meetings w KW

	* Meetings will take place every two weeks and last up to 1 hour
	* The nature of these meetings will be updating and unblocking (either by KW or through KW’s networking)
	* To schedule meetings w KW, go to KW’s Google calendar (which will send invite to Turing email)
	* Use meeting doc template, which is prepared in advance to meetings and saved in project repository on GitHub
	* KW advised that additional information about meetings and general ‘settling in’ questions can be found on Whitaker lab GitHub page

* Standards for reporting medical data

	* KW suggested I look into OHDSI OMOP, which is a standard for reporting medical data

* The concept of “structured missingness”

	* KW suggested I be introduced to a group of people at the Turing who are dedicated to the concept of structured missingness. This group is often looking for projects, and my project would lend itself well to them.
  * This group has not yet been established; however, Prof Niels Peek, who will be part of the newly established group, has been involved in [research of similar nature in the past](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/advancing-methodology-predictive-healthcare).

* Earlier work between GOSH and the Turing

	* KW mentioned that GOSH and Turing have [previously collaborated](https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2020-02/the_alan_turing_institute_data_study_group_final_report_-_great_ormond_street_hospital.pdf).
    * This work looked at how vital signs monitoring data can be better used to inform the removal of a breathing tube (i.e. ‘extubation’) in intensive care units. The work involved the following 3 steps:
        * Identification and anonymisation of ICU admissions
        * Extraction of patient monitor data from the T3 system
        * Identification of extubation times and labelling ‘success’ or ‘failure’
    * Representatives from DRIVE were Ben Margetts and John Booth.
    * KW suggested being in touch with Markus Löning and Tony Bagnall at the Turing. 

* Open infrastructure

	* As lead of Tools, Practises and Systems, Kirstie is interested in open infrastructure, but from a person-perspective, i.e. she is interested in the people who build an open infrastructure and wants to create a culture that fosters this.
