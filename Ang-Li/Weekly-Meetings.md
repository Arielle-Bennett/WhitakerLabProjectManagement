* [17th Apirl 2019](#date-17th-April-2019)


### Date: 17th April 2019

#### Who did you help this week?

* Help NN by supervising her Python learning.

#### Who helped you this week?

* KW gave me much sopport, such as helping me to apply for a Cambridge Raven account. 
* GX helped me to build the FSA website. 
* AZ and OH helped me improve my revision work. 

#### What did you achieve?

* Almost finish the revision! The new result gained recognition from some top Chinese psychiatrists and OH! 
  OH is probably the most leading scientist in this specifc field, which means our biomarker has a plausible 
  potential clincal practice. 

* Move to a new house! The landlords are so nice and also the house. There are so many equipments including 
  dish-washing machine and drying machinery. I believe the London life will be easier. There's a big TV and 
  dining-table and a very gentle labrador. 

* Having a great discussion with AC and having emails with MS. AC is skilled in machine learning and interested 
  in psychiatry. Thanks KW for the introduing. MS's background is physics, imaging genetics et al and she had done 
  some really fantastic work, which were published in some top journals. 
  It will be great taht both AC and MS will attend our Turing group meeting. 

* Writing the analysis plan of IMAGEN data.

* Thinking deeply of what I can achieve in Turing. 


#### What did you struggle with?

* Cambridge server! I strangely lost my password and I had to go Cambridge to reset. Hope I can finish it 
  in this week. I wasted too much on this. 

* Having some different plans or opinions with KW, I'm afraid she will feel disappointment. I struggled but I
  still hope to discuss with her evently. 

* The applying of ABCD dataset as well as the download.

* Haven't got Turing card. 
 

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Improving revision basing on the comments from OH.

* Getting Cambridge server account and get enough space to analysis IMAGEN data. I hope I can do it and 
  run some code !!! If I can get enough space, I can download some dataset from OpenNeuro as KW suggested. 


#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* I hope she can help me to upload the IMAGEN data, as I have no fixed computer that can do this. I also hope she can 
  closely support me to use the server successfully. 

* Giving some suggestions on the coming Turing group meeting. (I guess many great ideas and collaboration will start from this meeting).

* I helped NN to make python learning plan  
  * KW: :snake: Fantastic!

#### *Who helped you this week?*

* MM helped me to join some slack channels in Turing.

KW: Great! Let me know if you have any questions or want to join in any of the activities :rocket:

#### *What did you achieve?*
* A substantial work for the revision of my under reviewed paper.
 * KW: Great - keep going :muscle:

  * KW: And I loved your comment in the review of my [weekly update PR](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/WhitakerLabProjectManagement/pull/254#issuecomment-476001309) :sparkles:
* Know the logic & reason of registered reports ([Registered Reports](https://cos.io/rr/))
  * KW: Great!
* Blog post for the Whitaker Lab! [https://github.com/WhitakerLab/whitakerlab.github.io/pull/46](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/whitakerlab.github.io/pull/46)

#### *What did you struggle with?*
* in a world of oneâ€™s own (but I have to at this time)
* My eyes are not fully recovered from the laser surgery, making it hard to work with my laptop for long time 
* My spoken English seems terrible and block the in-depth communication with others

KW: You're doing great! It's so hard to be in a new place. Take care of yourself and I'll have a look for details of the immersive language course in Cambridge (or London).
  * Link to discounted oyster card: https://tfl.gov.uk/fares/free-and-discounted-travel/18-plus-student-oyster-photocard

#### *What would you like to work on next week?*
* Take some time on revision
* Organize the thought to deal with IMAGEN data
* Know someone in Turing

#### *Where do you need help from Kirstie?*
* Finding a HPC: as it is important to organize & analyze IMAGEN data.
  * KW: Yes - I can get you access to the Cambridge HPC.
* Some suggestions for brain science salon or group meeting, as YN and I may need some regular environments to communicate with more people in this field.
  * KW: Great call. I think the events at the ICN might be useful: https://www.ucl.ac.uk/icn, https://www.ucl.ac.uk/icn/seminars
  * Also the Turing mental health interest group does some interesting work: https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/data-science-mental-health, https://turing-ds4mh.github.io
* Some comments on revision if had time.

This is all great Ang!! Well done. I've made an issue for our next two meetings: https://github.com/WhitakerLab/WhitakerLabProjectManagement/issues/256.
