### Date: 03 June 2019

#### Who did you help this week?

* I'm struggling to remember any human interactions ever....my mind is blank.

#### Who helped you this week?

* CH gave me a lot of his time to chat and mull over next steps
* Other than that, again, I have an empty brain (oh dear....)


#### What did you achieve?

* I got my health policy project to a point where it makes a lot more sense now. I think on the whole it's a lot weaker than I was hoping (and awkwardly, I found a paper that got published last year which had a VERY similar approach which I hadn't pick up before. Doh!)
* I almost finished my community detection project which is kiiiiinda neat I guess, but is just another way of trying to describe A LOT of data, over a LONG period of time more clearly
* I started to hide in Oxford libraries/a bit more in Oxford and I am getting SO much more work done there. Life is just quieter. Definitely going to bunk here a lot more during writing up
* I rebuilt the whole OHT website, massively cleaned the database and just feel much happier with the backend infrastructure now. It's been really fun thinking (in the smallest of ways) about the platform and processes to make OHT work the best. Also a direct Kirstie influence, we've published all our templates,  handbooks and resources online https://www.onehealthtech.com/resources
* I wrote a piecee in Forbes which is really not where I should be spending my writing time but I really enjoyed boshing it out https://www.forbes.com/sites/maxinemackintosh/2019/06/01/23andme-and-airbnbis-cultural-identity-a-market-to-explore-for-consumer-genetic-testing-companies/#7624202e448f



#### What did you struggle with?

* Still got some £££ work to tie up which is hanging over my head but I needed to do it in the short term (lol...) and it means that no matter what happens I can chill out about money until January
* I struggled with the fact that at my institute everyone just applies methods, understanding the logic underpinning the methods, but not the underlying statistics say. Being at the ATI, that feels like a cardinal sin. But actually, I've never known any different and I'm not good enough at stats to do lot's of the stuff others around me are doing. So I'm finding that quite stressful, as I guess what is profound to one community will be basic for another
* Usual overwhelming balance of PhD, OHT, Maxine-other stuff

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Next week is London Tech Week... which is HECTIC and in hindsight I shouldn't be doing so much
I'm being conservative in my ambitions and would like to have merely run my ML classifiers on REAL data....everything is crossed for them to simply WORK.

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* I think some tips on how to structure my time in the write-up months would be useful

#### Any other topics
* I'm pretty sure I want to do a post-doc.... there... I said it!
* I own a house! (ish... Alexander does..). WE own a house. Got keys and all. Woooo. 

---------------------
### Date: 13 May 2019

#### Who did you help this week?

* A really nice doctor who was asking about PhDs at the Turing 
* Someone getting bullied to hell at work so much they've quit, so just helping some with some of the HR issues when the startup is so small it doesnt have HR

#### Who helped you this week?

* IA-Z on forcing me to do wholesome track sessions at the Regent's Park track


#### What did you achieve?

* Ended up taking most of the week off to work for additional £££ - Still haven't been paid but this was 1.5 months stipend for a week's work so I kinda had to take it 

#### What did you struggle with?

* PhD guilt for not really working this week on PhD OR last weeek

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Same as my aim for last week -
* Now that I've had the go ahead from RA & AGI on the health policy paper to start compiling my new paper
* Meet with SD to discuss what to do with my rejected paper
* This week I want to finish Part 1 of my networks project (which is my sequence pattern mining bit)

* Also, I have the PhDRUK event which should be nice

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* We've got breakfast in the diary re OHT
* I guess have a bit of your take on "writing up". I dont think I fully understand what it means because I have so much "stuff" written up but lots not - a realistic timeline thrashing out would be good for writing goal-setting :)

#### Any other topics

---------------------

### Date: 7 May 2019

#### Who did you help this week?

* PhD student who got quite stressed about the Enrichment Scheme application who I helped (albeit a while back) got an offer! Yay!

* Lots of Hub volunteers! Feels quite nice to be interacting with everyone again


#### Who helped you this week?

* AO - Our new awesome developer for OHT in Nigeria
* RA & AGI on doing a light touch review of my totally re-worked health policy paper. Luckily it's now not totally shit!
* WCT & TH to sort out my huge being paid isssue - haven't been paid since December :-( (+ mum and dad for loaning me money)

#### What did you achieve?

* Honestly, I've had quite a distracted 10 days with OHT :-( But within that, I achieved A LOT!
* I totally re-built the OHT website with a combo of Wix, crappy Javascript and a bit of professional help. Honeslty I am SO chuffed, and it also gave me a feeling I need to reflect on. I like BUILDING things, not so much ANALYSING things. The infinitely far goal-post is just a bit.... lame. Hoping to launch this week (with plenty of bugs I'm sure but I'm still chuffed and it looks well sexy.
* Re-did ALL the Hub Handbooks to reflect new ways of working 
* Started reviewing my 22 UKRI assessments (£££!)
* Had some brain space and clearly articulated my last network analysis project - that has 3 parts. All of which I have done about 50% of I realis which makes me further ahead than I thought
* Sorted out an organised A LOT of unclaimed expenses (woops), but least it will feel like I'm getting paid
* Did another 3 interviews for my consumer data project
* Ran another successful event at the ATI: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MRmljdyDkY

#### What did you struggle with?

* My upgrade paper finally got rejected, with really helpful comments like "EHR is not a useful term"...
* Frustration that I was getting so PhD distracted but also aware if I don't do this now it will be really terrible over the summer

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Now that I've had the go ahead from RA & AGI on the health policy paper to start compiling my new paper
* Meet with SD to discuss what to do with my rejected paper
* This week I want to finish Part 1 of my networks project (which is my sequence pattern mining bit)

  * KW: AAAAAH SO COOL!

#### What did you struggle with?

### Date: 8 April 2019

#### Who did you help this week?

* JP/Digital Health Oxford with a morale-boost on the pains of running communities
  * KW :heart:
* SD fromm the Health Foundation on NHS/analytics/open stuff (sent her to stalk KW)
  * KW: Did I get this message and miss it?
* WH on my thoughts on weird and fun stuff NHSX could be doing
* YM get into a swanky event with Conde Nast

#### Who helped you this week?

* DF & PB on thinking through OHT commercial stuff
* JM on dealing with toxic people/patronising people
  * KW: Ooooph. Share those skills onwards :hugging:

#### What did you achieve?

* This week was a bit too event-heavy, but all were SO worth it which is rare.... 
* Monday: Really interesting Women in Health dinner with Deloitte where we set the world straight
* Tuesday morning: ICHP & Draper event on how data and the public system interface (#intersections)
* Wednesday: Spoke at an Optum Labs event about my 3 basic things to watch when trying to translate "new analytical methods" (those things were feature engingeering, what outcome metric you're optimising/is it economically viable, and simple models often work better with NHS data)
  * KW: OH I LOVE IT!
* Thursday: Saw Mariana Mazzucato speak about the "Value of everything" which was predictably impressive
* Did a whole day of interviews for the 2 new OHT roles and have found PERFECT people! Fingers crossed they accept
  * KW: AAAAAAH! 🥂

* Did all the followup and wrap up from my Oxford students day out, feedback coming in and was very positive!
  * KW: YAY!

#### What did you struggle with?

* I reeeally struggled with the quirks of working with network classes in R. I'm new to them and felt like I was stuck on a few lines of code for aaaaagees. Next week is basically empty so I'm really looking forward to getting more confident with tidygraph generally as the bits and bobs here and there mean I haven't got to grips with how the package works
  * KW: :muscle:

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Become more confident with tidygraph and try to get some sound analyses, as the first batch from this week were correct but didn't tell me much (doh!)
* Re-draft (in quite a big way) my health policy paper

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Nothing :-)

#### Any other topics

KW: Still amazing 🤯

### Date: 1 April 2019

#### Who did you help this week?

* Oxford Grad Medical students - Organised a big day out visiting interesting healthtech companies


#### Who helped you this week?

* AF... always...especially on OHT next plan of action
* KW in being sympathetic and showing some love


#### What did you achieve?

* Presented at a big NHS-tech conference full of fancy people. Went really well!
* Successfully transferred and re-coded most of my preliminary network analysis thus far into the Safe Haven! Alas the first results are not as jammy as I was hoping
* Did my first consumer data interview, it went really well, lots of flow, but need to think about how to ask more awkward questions
* I completed my information governance re-validation... wooop...
* Got accepted to AAIC https://www.alz.org/aaic/overview.asp (poster and a presentation)! LA in July baby! (though, it clashes with writing up so not sure I'mm going to go)
* Wrote a big proposal for BSA Media Fellowship/WCMT/OHT - Health ATI stuff for CH. Overall not very successful
* Not really an "achievement" but I went to a Royal Society AI in Health workshop, and felt like I learnt and contributed well


#### What did you struggle with?

* Not much, was quite a hectic week with events, proposals, field trips etc. Just felt like I was on a bit of a treadmill, so no time to enjoy or struggle
* I would say I struggled with the fact I didn't really feel like I did any meaningul PhD work, as the little I did was just re-coding. But that was always going to be the case, April is when everything gets a lot quieter because I have made it as such (yay to saying NO)
* Not struggle per se but still prodding people for comments on my policy paper (the 2 most important people who do lots of work in this area haven't commented, so still plugging away)


#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Deeper dive into my network analyses - want to play around with different community dection, and impact models
* Recruit a transcriber for my interviews. F*** no am I doing that
* Present at an Optum Labs event 
* ACTUALLY draft a blog for Forbes/The Agenda... I keep putting it to the bottom of the list
* Friday is a day of interviews for the new OHT Commercial Director. Eeeeek, hope we have good people! It's looking v good
* But mostly... just do a lot more head down analysis compared to last week

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Get comments on my policy paper in the Gdoc

#### Any other topics

### Date: 25 March 2019

#### Who did you help this week?

* CH have a think about the Health programme
* Medical student who is trying to raise money to attend an MIT programme. Worked with her on writing a post to disseminate: https://onehealthtech.com/blog-post/from-medical-student-to-mit-harvard-health-innovation-bootcamper/

KW: These are both AWESOME ways to help! Tweeted the OHT link.


#### Who helped you this week?

* AF on being resilient through some tough news at the start of the week
  * KW: I don't think I know what this is (and I don't have to). But HUGS.
* Audience in a presentation I did on my policy paper. No one cared about the changepoints, everyone was just interested in WHY dementia incidence had decreased. That was helpful insight.
  * KW: Oooooh fascinating. Surprising...but super useful!
* CL, DW, CE on final organisational bits for the OHT & ATI healthtech policy lunchtime session. Made it a breeze to run
  * KW: YAY! I'm so sad I missed it! I hope it went well.
* NG from ATI Partnerships who has been MIND-BLOWINGLY helpful in facilitating introductions for the consumer data piece of work. Really gone above and beyond to help find people from the Turing's partners and networks which is so kind
  * KW: Aaaaaaah - this makes me so happy :heart_eyes:

#### What did you achieve?

* Submitted my policy paper for comments (finally!)
* Presented my policy paper in UCL Institute of Health Informatics informal "Research Huddle"
* Got a really good preliminary network analysis working out of the Safe Haven, though when I transferred it inside, my EHR data was too big and so now will need to re-code everything again. Boooo. V excited about this though. Feels nice to be doing new analyses.
  * KW: GAH - stay strong. Ditto on the exciting analyses!!
* Ran a successful OHT & ATI event on healthtech policy. People seemed to have a good time and DW was super friendly and fun with all the AV work
* Ran an OHT in Oxford/Reading briefing session. Have identified an amazingly cool team to run the Hub there!
* Had a good emo session with CH & wrote up the discussion and actions. In awe of their openness
  * KW: :purple_heart:
* Provided very thorough edits on a Reform think tank report at the moment on Data-driven technologies in Mental Health


#### What did you struggle with?

* You know what. There was a fair bit of crying. Enormous emotional exhaustion this week. AV resigned from OHT on Monday (for perfectly good reasons) but we are recruiting for a new commercial person anyway, so it's going to be very tough having 2 new people at the same time at the start of May, where I will have to do a lot of handover work... and keep finding money. Really dont want to be spending my time on important but complex things like this at the moment,  it feels very trapping. And all I want to do is PhD right now... also has brought up all sorts of negative feelings that I'm doing a really shit job with OHT, I manage badly, people think we are rubbish/I'm rubbish, we have grand plans but never deliver etc etc. My head is in the sand at the moment because I'd much rather be building my network analyses...
  * KW: Ooooooph, lady. [Great big hugs](https://media.giphy.com/media/Lb3vIJjaSIQWA/giphy.gif). You're delivering all over the freaking shop, but I know the feeling of not being able to do as much as you'd hope.
  * Shall we go for a Dishoom breakfast? Let me know if that would be helpful.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Not a lot of time as Monday is at a big NHS technology leadership conference I'm speaking at. Thursday I'm taking my Oxford students for a day out in London to visit cool healthtech organisations and Friday is this Royal Society AI in health event
* Keep plodding away with my network analyses and the re-coding of that...
  * KW: Always fun to do network stuff in your "spare time" :wink: I hope you get some!

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Arbitrary deadline of Friday EOD for the policy paper commments 
  * KW: YEP - 2 hours in my calendar on Wednesday :muscle:
* Probably a chat about priorities and time-/energy-management given OHT difficulties
* Whopping email I sent last weekend has potentially solved itself (initiated by CH)... the BSA Fellowship website is very confusing and misleading though so would like your signature but I have to say, it's very unclear how/whether you can apply if your university isn't a "partner". I've emailed them for clarification
   * KW: Got this sent :white_check_mark: Let me know if you need any more.

#### Any other topics

* Mortgage FINALLY got accepted after about 3 months. Phew/Jesus christ that was tough.

-----------


### Date: 18 March 2019

#### Who did you help this week?

* Had quite a few cold-emails asking for advice on PhDs, general chatting etc These can end up being very time-consuming but I hope my input has been helpful

#### Who helped you this week?

* KW and CL on grootgif-ing life
  * :heart: :muscle: 
* AF and JH on brainstorming on what I'm going to be when I grow up.... still not much clearer
  * KW: Whooooo knows. (Going to reply to your email today....)

#### What did you achieve?

* Recovered from IWD-week... whilst a celebratory week, I'm glad it only happens annually!
* Went on holiday and had a good break
* Used the half-a-week I had after the holiday to lots of the little bitty bits like Information Governance training re-validation, following interviewees for the consumer data project, working on making some of my health policy paper graphics less ugly... I'm half way there 
  * KW: This all sounds amazing. Super fun!
* Had a really positive conversation with OL, easy and potentially v aligned collaboration for a generalisability paper there which would be super exciting!
  * KW: Awesome - tell me more when you next mett :sparkles:

#### What did you struggle with?

* Acceptance that skiing holidays, when in a whiteout, are a total, and very painfully large, waste of money
  * KW: With delicious hot chocolate?
* Strengthening the narrative of this policy paper, I still find it a bit weak!
  * KW: Happy to help - I haven't had any time this week but I'll take a look next week :smiley_cat:
  
#### What would you like to work on next week?

* ACTUALLY send a draft of the policy paper round, which I've been avoiding for a while 
  * KW: :tada: On the reading list for next week.
* Identify a journal/conference that would be good to send it to
* Run the first of the OHT healthtech policy sessions successfully
* Have an important emo day with CH in Oxford
  * KW: :rocket::dizzy:
* Go back to where I left off with the network analyses
* Draft H2RaA with JF
* Provide edits on MS's multiscale ethics paper
* Draft a piece for Forbes/The Agenda/FT 

KW: These all look incredible! Way to go :sparkles:

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Comments on the policy paper, particularly a) Strength of narrative and b) Viz... better than before but still not as good as it could be
* See email I sent re WCMT Fellowship & BSA Fellowship in the Autumn

KW: Can do - sorry I haven't been able to this week. Really excited to read the paper!

#### Any other topics
* Had a lovely evening meeting KW's happy crew. Nice to meet people not so deep in the healthtech bubble/cave that you have the same conversation on repeat
* Turing Enrichmen video: Skip to 2.21, some KW luuuuurve https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvFDb1_nezM
  * KW: AAAAAAAAAH! So lovely :heart_eyes::heart_eyes::heart_eyes:

###  Date: 29 October 2018

#### Who did you help this week?

* I helped O(?) from the business team by joining a small discussion group about what the ATI could/should be doing in entrepreneurship
* I helped the new PhDs feel more bonded this week by organising a curry on Friday night (15 people came, woop), it was super fun and everyone seemed to have a good time, and also were very appreciative which is always nice
* I had a breakfast meeting with a new grad from my LSE MSc to help her think about what she wants to do next and did a bunch of introductions
* I helped 6 people with introductions to others through OHT who could help with all sorts, from getting an internship to working out whether to leave clinical practice for the world of tech
* I helped one of the enrichment student's mentees who was keen for us to meet. It's difficult to know what I did but clearly made her happy and now she knows I'm on the end of an email I guess. She was awesome, super smart and had so much of a her s--t together for a 3rd year CS student  


#### Who helped you this week?

* AV helped me be a better psuedo-boss/pseudo-cofunder/pseudo team player in OHT. I need to work on cultural awareness around jokes, consistent levels of feedback (ie not micromanaging one moment and relaxed the next), communicating with clarity, filtering the excessive number of thoughts in my head
* KW and SF helped me with GitHub stuff (longest journey starts with smallest step)
  * KW: THANK YOU!!! I really appreciate you figuring this out!
* JH helped me get my head around Python in the RSE course
* R(?) sat next to me in RSE and was very sweet in explaining Python <-> R translation. He does both and it was so much easier to understand Python by going at it through an R lens (for me personally)
  * KW: YAAAAY Super super helpful :sparkles: 
* SD, MR, AF helped me by giving back comments on my ethics 
* AF and I drank loads of engagement champagne and he gave me a pep talk about academia and keeping me motivated. He's so wise and so great
* Through OHT, we convened a big dinner with senior movers, shakers, sponsors to help us strategiically with our next steps. They were all very helpful in giving us ideas about viable business models and impact
* Reading KW blog from when she went to speak to her previous school. So many warm fuzzies. So good I get to hang out with her ;-)
  * KW: Awwwww :sparkling_heart:
* KW totally taking over my Twitter feed at Mozfest, but helped me see a) How to run more inclusive events (should have sent AV for a wrecky) b) That the Mozilla lot seem like a really friendly community 
  * KW: It was sooooo much fun! Reasonably overwhelming but always inspiring :heart_eyes:
  * KW: Next round applications are open now: https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/apply/. I think the culture track would be perfect for OHT but a project might be easier to think concretely about.

#### What did you achieve?

* I finished my policy paper analysis (yay!). Chuffed because I changed a lot of the code to be more efficient/looped so when comments come back it, it should be WAY easier to make changes compared to the upgrade paper code
  * KW: AAAAAAAH!!! YEAAAAAAAAAH :raised_hands: :raised_hands: :raised_hands: Fantastic :sparkles:
* I wrote a piece summarising the government's new tech vision (https://www.forbes.com/sites/maxinemackintosh/2018/10/28/uk-announces-its-vision-for-nhs-technology-and-its-not-sexy/#1e8aa79d178b)
  * KW: Fab - added to the reading list!
* I completed my ethics, I was very very slow because I was so so bored, so I am pleased to have comments back already as what I produced was tripe. In hindsight I should have written up the content separately and THEN moulded it into all the 10s of ethics documents pages
  * KW: It was really good!! I have a few comments - I'll put them in the word doc :smiley:
* I completed session 2 on the RSE course
  * KW: :star2:

#### What did you struggle with?

* GitHub (obv...)
* Confusing Python and R code in the RSE course
* Keeping motivated whilst writing my ethics application
* Disappointment that my new results from my re-run policy analysis with the full and proper data, so far, arent as "good" as the previous version which is fine, but also a shame
* Work dinners 4/5 nights last week. Need to watch the daily glass of wine (!?)

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* I didn't really manage to do my methods image for the upgrade paper other than some hand-drawings so would like to work on that, but also slightly apprehensive (in a good way) about all the other edits KW will send my way so probably best to do them all together so that I'm in the zooooone 
  * KW: Sorry we didn't get to this - lets continue the conversation!!
* RSE homework, will struggle with the Python if I don't sort that out
* Need to write up a framework/proposal for the AI in health supplement I have been asked to edit (probably a 2 week project)
* Meet with AGI to talk a) Multiple testing and b) Policy paper
* Draft out the policy paper (bullet points) so it's easier to share, and be absolutely sure I understand the methods as I realised I had forgotten a fair amount from the spring when I first did the analyses
  * KW: Excited for this! I think this is going to be super fun!

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Talk through the rest of the comments on the paper (meeting scheduled)
* Go over GitHub-gaphs
* Clarify a bit of a timeline because I'm not sure that with the policy paper, upgrade paper, consumer data ethics proposal + usual extra bits and bobs I have head space to get back into the patterrn mining/network next project but can see the usual slippage emerging...

#### Any other topics

KW: Thank you so much for writing up such lovely notes! I'm so delighted that we're working together :smiley_cat:

### Date: 1 October 2018

#### Who did you help this week?

* I helped a few PhD students who are just starting out with some bit of supposed tacet knowledge the system presents you with
* I helped some enrichment students with accomodation problems/sofas to crash as well as random bits and bobs like the existance of the Trainline app
  * KW: These are LOVELY helpful actions. THANK YOU :sparkling_heart:
* I helped a PhD student realise pretty much every joke he made was sexist. Ah well.
  * KW: And this one is good for the world and super frustrating for you. Thank you though!
  
#### Who helped you this week?

* JH helped me understand the interface of GitHub and agile project management
* KW helped me make my visualisations clearer despite my ggplot inadequacies
* General PhD students and business team helped me by smiling, making me feel welcome, having good senses of humour, complimenting my clothes and generally being luuuush to hang around with
  * KW: YAAAAAY! :sparkles:
  
#### What did you achieve?

* I managed to integrate multiple reviewers' comments on the first draft of my prodromal dementia paper...many months after I had hoped
* I think I genuinely made quite big steps towards more neatly and coherently assimilating a large volume of results for a clinical audience
* I reduced my GitHub anxiety by a teensy weensy little bitty bit

#### What did you struggle with?

* Remembering what I had written, and why in my paper... and then dealing with the boredom of agonising over minutiae bits of the paper 
* GitHub (unless you hadnt realised by now)
* Not crashing and breaking Overleaf whilst I decide how to appease a wide spectrum of supervisors' favourite writing places
  * KW: Note to self: required solution is word!

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Next week is not really normal work week as I am attending an NHS Digital meeting on Monday, I have a 3 day "datathon" and then my sister is getting married. With that said however, at the Alzheimer's Innovation Workshop I want to:
*   Get familiar with useful tools for a datathon-type environment
*   Meet lots of fellow dementia/data nerds to examine me, collaborate with me, generlaly hang out with me
*   Start to develop a better understanding of how you build actual "stuff" through aforementioned tools and a smooth end-to-end analysis 
*   Learn about either genetics or imaging in AD and how that can complement my project (as I think thats the DPUK data we are using)
*   Get some ideas for ENRICHING (tick!) this year's projects

* I will also be reviewing a whole bunch of abstracts for the King's Fund Digital Health & Care congress, unfortunately over the datathon days so will be a few late nights for sure

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Nowhere really other than comments back on the paper (ideally faster than in 4 months)
* Maaaaaybe advice on whether I should set an MSc project for the Institute of Health Informatics students. They need way more projects set and it would be this summer but don't know if it's a good idea/worth it given my PhD timeline

#### Any other topics

* SD has got his MSc students 6 months free for Data Camp (which I luuurve) so might try and more systematically learn a few things... currently undecided which as I've enrolled on just about everything
