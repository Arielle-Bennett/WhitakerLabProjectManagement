###  Date: 29 October 2018

#### Who did you help this week?

* I helped O(?) from the business team by joining a small discussion group about what the ATI could/should be doing in entrepreneurship
* I helped the new PhDs feel more bonded this week by organising a curry on Friday night (15 people came, woop), it was super fun and everyone seemed to have a good time, and also were very appreciative which is always nice
* I had a breakfast meeting with a new grad from my LSE MSc to help her think about what she wants to do next and did a bunch of introductions
* I helped 6 people with introductions to others through OHT who could help with all sorts, from getting an internship to working out whether to leave clinical practice for the world of tech
* I helped one of the enrichment student's mentees who was keen for us to meet. It's difficult to know what I did but clearly made her happy and now she knows I'm on the end of an email I guess. She was awesome, super smart and had so much of a her s--t together for a 3rd year CS student  


#### Who helped you this week?

* AV helped me be a better psuedo-boss/pseudo-cofunder/pseudo team player in OHT. I need to work on cultural awareness around jokes, consistent levels of feedback (ie not micromanaging one moment and relaxed the next), communicating with clarity, filtering the excessive number of thoughts in my head
* KW and SF helped me with GitHub stuff (longest journey starts with smallest step)
  * KW: THANK YOU!!! I really appreciate you figuring this out!
* JH helped me get my head around Python in the RSE course
* R(?) sat next to me in RSE and was very sweet in explaining Python <-> R translation. He does both and it was so much easier to understand Python by going at it through an R lens (for me personally)
  * KW: YAAAAY Super super helpful :sparkles: 
* SD, MR, AF helped me by giving back comments on my ethics 
* AF and I drank loads of engagement champagne and he gave me a pep talk about academia and keeping me motivated. He's so wise and so great
* Through OHT, we convened a big dinner with senior movers, shakers, sponsors to help us strategiically with our next steps. They were all very helpful in giving us ideas about viable business models and impact
* Reading KW blog from when she went to speak to her previous school. So many warm fuzzies. So good I get to hang out with her ;-)
  * KW: Awwwww :sparkling_heart:
* KW totally taking over my Twitter feed at Mozfest, but helped me see a) How to run more inclusive events (should have sent AV for a wrecky) b) That the Mozilla lot seem like a really friendly community 
  * KW: It was sooooo much fun! Reasonably overwhelming but always inspiring :heart_eyes:
  * KW: Next round applications are open now: https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/apply/. I think the culture track would be perfect for OHT but a project might be easier to think concretely about.

#### What did you achieve?

* I finished my policy paper analysis (yay!). Chuffed because I changed a lot of the code to be more efficient/looped so when comments come back it, it should be WAY easier to make changes compared to the upgrade paper code
  * KW: AAAAAAAH!!! YEAAAAAAAAAH :raised_hands: :raised_hands: :raised_hands: Fantastic :sparkles:
* I wrote a piece summarising the government's new tech vision (https://www.forbes.com/sites/maxinemackintosh/2018/10/28/uk-announces-its-vision-for-nhs-technology-and-its-not-sexy/#1e8aa79d178b)
  * KW: Fab - added to the reading list!
* I completed my ethics, I was very very slow because I was so so bored, so I am pleased to have comments back already as what I produced was tripe. In hindsight I should have written up the content separately and THEN moulded it into all the 10s of ethics documents pages
  * KW: It was really good!! I have a few comments - I'll put them in the word doc :smiley:
* I completed session 2 on the RSE course
  * KW: :star2:

#### What did you struggle with?

* GitHub (obv...)
* Confusing Python and R code in the RSE course
* Keeping motivated whilst writing my ethics application
* Disappointment that my new results from my re-run policy analysis with the full and proper data, so far, arent as "good" as the previous version which is fine, but also a shame
* Work dinners 4/5 nights last week. Need to watch the daily glass of wine (!?)

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* I didn't really manage to do my methods image for the upgrade paper other than some hand-drawings so would like to work on that, but also slightly apprehensive (in a good way) about all the other edits KW will send my way so probably best to do them all together so that I'm in the zooooone 
  * KW: Sorry we didn't get to this - lets continue the conversation!!
* RSE homework, will struggle with the Python if I don't sort that out
* Need to write up a framework/proposal for the AI in health supplement I have been asked to edit (probably a 2 week project)
* Meet with AGI to talk a) Multiple testing and b) Policy paper
* Draft out the policy paper (bullet points) so it's easier to share, and be absolutely sure I understand the methods as I realised I had forgotten a fair amount from the spring when I first did the analyses
  * KW: Excited for this! I think this is going to be super fun!

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Talk through the rest of the comments on the paper (meeting scheduled)
* Go over GitHub-gaphs
* Clarify a bit of a timeline because I'm not sure that with the policy paper, upgrade paper, consumer data ethics proposal + usual extra bits and bobs I have head space to get back into the patterrn mining/network next project but can see the usual slippage emerging...

#### Any other topics

KW: Thank you so much for writing up such lovely notes! I'm so delighted that we're working together :smiley_cat:

### Date: 1 October 2018

#### Who did you help this week?

* I helped a few PhD students who are just starting out with some bit of supposed tacet knowledge the system presents you with
* I helped some enrichment students with accomodation problems/sofas to crash as well as random bits and bobs like the existance of the Trainline app
  * KW: These are LOVELY helpful actions. THANK YOU :sparkling_heart:
* I helped a PhD student realise pretty much every joke he made was sexist. Ah well.
  * KW: And this one is good for the world and super frustrating for you. Thank you though!
  
#### Who helped you this week?

* JH helped me understand the interface of GitHub and agile project management
* KW helped me make my visualisations clearer despite my ggplot inadequacies
* General PhD students and business team helped me by smiling, making me feel welcome, having good senses of humour, complimenting my clothes and generally being luuuush to hang around with
  * KW: YAAAAAY! :sparkles:
  
#### What did you achieve?

* I managed to integrate multiple reviewers' comments on the first draft of my prodromal dementia paper...many months after I had hoped
* I think I genuinely made quite big steps towards more neatly and coherently assimilating a large volume of results for a clinical audience
* I reduced my GitHub anxiety by a teensy weensy little bitty bit

#### What did you struggle with?

* Remembering what I had written, and why in my paper... and then dealing with the boredom of agonising over minutiae bits of the paper 
* GitHub (unless you hadnt realised by now)
* Not crashing and breaking Overleaf whilst I decide how to appease a wide spectrum of supervisors' favourite writing places
  * KW: Note to self: required solution is word!

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Next week is not really normal work week as I am attending an NHS Digital meeting on Monday, I have a 3 day "datathon" and then my sister is getting married. With that said however, at the Alzheimer's Innovation Workshop I want to:
*   Get familiar with useful tools for a datathon-type environment
*   Meet lots of fellow dementia/data nerds to examine me, collaborate with me, generlaly hang out with me
*   Start to develop a better understanding of how you build actual "stuff" through aforementioned tools and a smooth end-to-end analysis 
*   Learn about either genetics or imaging in AD and how that can complement my project (as I think thats the DPUK data we are using)
*   Get some ideas for ENRICHING (tick!) this year's projects

* I will also be reviewing a whole bunch of abstracts for the King's Fund Digital Health & Care congress, unfortunately over the datathon days so will be a few late nights for sure

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Nowhere really other than comments back on the paper (ideally faster than in 4 months)
* Maaaaaybe advice on whether I should set an MSc project for the Institute of Health Informatics students. They need way more projects set and it would be this summer but don't know if it's a good idea/worth it given my PhD timeline

#### Any other topics

* SD has got his MSc students 6 months free for Data Camp (which I luuurve) so might try and more systematically learn a few things... currently undecided which as I've enrolled on just about everything
