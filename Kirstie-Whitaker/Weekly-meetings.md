#### Who did you help this week?

* I finally attended a Collaborations Workshop 2019 planning meeting.
  I think I was useful there.
* AL when she was having a tough week
* I'm KB's buddy at the Turing, so I guess I helped DB in saying yes to that meeting, and hopefully I gave KB some useful information :smiley_cat::wave:
* Caught a mini data snafoo.
  I think that was pretty useful :grimacing:

#### Who helped you this week?

* JC & NB as panel members for the Autistica job interviews
* Really happy with SG's presentation for the Turing Way.
  Very excited to share such an interactive demo :sparkles:
* RJ's "interview" about data wrangling for Turing Way
* GA on Autistica ethics
* FN for thinking of me and coordinating a great meeting
* HD, MM and MJ for their wonderful shout outs and generous gifts: https://twitter.com/kirstie_j/status/1092757545696022528 :heart_eyes::heart_eyes::heart_eyes:
* Loved the chat and walk around town w NP

#### What did you achieve?

* (Eventually) Got the edits and response to reviewers done for DS4ED paper :grimacing:

  Goal is to be invited as a speaker on that project next year!
  I really think they'll like it :muscle:
* Gave talk on FAIR data at reproducible research lunch drop in

* Selection criteria for postdoc interviews, could have been much clearer from the beginning.
  * Send questions in advance
  * Ask for letters when short listed
  * Plan for 2 stage interview process

#### Any other topics

I didn't do the work I wanted to this weekend, but I think I just need to adjust my expectations of what I can achieve on a weekend.
I did do two 5K runs though, get some sleep, did some reading and had tonnes of fun with my family.
So all in all, time well spent :hugs:
