# Abstracts and bios

This is a file of all the talk abstracts and bios I write for events in 2019.

Hopefully I'll be able to re-use at least some of them ;)

They're ordered by date of presentation so ideally they're a little easier to find.

**Date**: 17 January 2019

**Title**: Championing Reproducibility: The Turing Way

**Abstract**: *Abstract*

**Bio**: Kirstie Whitaker is a research fellow at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) (London, UK) and a senior research associate in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge. She completed her PhD in Neuroscience at the University of California, Berkeley in 2012 and holds a BSc in Physics from the University of Bristol and an MSc in Medical Physics from the University of British Columbia. Her postdoctoral work was conducted in the Brain Mapping Unit at the University of Cambridge from 2012 to 2017. Dr Whitaker uses magnetic resonance imaging to study child and adolescent brain development and is a passionate advocate for reproducible neuroscience. She is a Fulbright scholarship alumna and 2016/17 [Mozilla Fellow for Science](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/fellowships/fellows). Kirstie was named, with her collaborator Petra Vertes, as a [2016 Global Thinker](https://gt.foreignpolicy.com/2016/profile/petra-vertes-and-kirstie-whitaker) by Foreign Policy magazine. You can find more information at her lab website: [whitakerlab.github.io](https://whitakerlab.github.io/).

### Keynote at csv,conf,v4

**Website**: https://csvconf.com

**Date**: 8 & 9 May 2019

**Title**: *Talk title*

**Abstract**: *Abstract*

**Bio**: Kirstie Whitaker is a research fellow at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) (London, UK) and senior research associate in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge.
Her work covers a broad range of interests and methods, but the driving principle is to improve the lives of people with mental health disorders.
Dr Whitaker uses magnetic resonance imaging to study child and adolescent brain development and participatory citizen science to educate non-autistic people about how they can better support autistic friends and colleagues.
She is the lead developer of ["The Turing Way"](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way), an openly developed educational resource to enable more reproducible data science.
Kirstie is a passionate advocate for making science "open for all" by promoting equity and inclusion for people from diverse backgrounds, and by changing the academic incentive structure to reward collaborative working.
She is the chair of the Turing Institute's Ethics Advisory Group, a Fulbright scholarship alumna and was a 2016/17 [Mozilla Fellow for Science](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/fellowships/fellows).
Kirstie was named, with her collaborator Petra Vertes, as a [2016 Global Thinker](https://gt.foreignpolicy.com/2016/profile/petra-vertes-and-kirstie-whitaker) by Foreign Policy magazine.
