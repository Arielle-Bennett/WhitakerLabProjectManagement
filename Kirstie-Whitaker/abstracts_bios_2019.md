### Nomura (for LGBT History Month)

**Date**: 13 February 2019

**Title**: Alan Turing: Life and Legacy

**Abstract**: In celebration of LGBT History Month 2019, I will give a brief overview of the life of Alan Turing and discuss the legacy of a gay man who shortened World War II by two years (or more) before dying by suicide aged 41.
Voted the [most iconic scientist](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/5jQ6817N7QWTz5bJJspyDNy/alan-turing) of the 20th century in a recent [BBC TV series](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0by86tp), Turing designed the first "universal computing machine" and the "Turing Test", two fundamental building blocks of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.
Today, researchers at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) are carrying his legacy forward through their innovative and interdisciplinary solutions to data driven questions.
I will explain why technology must be built by diverse and inclusive communities, and the pitfalls that come from homogeneous groups of developers.
Although homosexuality is no longer illegal in the UK, we still need better representation of LGBTQ+ people in data science and artificial intelligence.
Invoking Turing's early death, I will encourage all members of the audience to reflect on their communities:
Whose voices are we not hearing?
Whose expertise have we lost?
How do we ensure that future Turings can meet their greatest potential?

**Bio**: Dr Kirstie Whitaker is a research fellow at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) (London, UK) and senior research associate in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge.
She completed her PhD in Neuroscience at the University of California, Berkeley in 2012 and holds a BSc in Physics from the University of Bristol and an MSc in Medical Physics from the University of British Columbia.
Her work covers a broad range of interests and methods, but the driving principle is to improve the lives of people with mental health disorders.
Kirstie is a passionate advocate for making science "open for all" by promoting equity and inclusion for people from diverse backgrounds, and by changing the academic incentive structure to reward collaborative working.
She is the chair of the Turing Institute's Ethics Advisory Group, a Fulbright scholarship alumna and was a 2016/17 [Mozilla Fellow for Science](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/fellowships/fellows).
Kirstie was named, with her collaborator Petra Vertes, as a [2016 Global Thinker](https://gt.foreignpolicy.com/2016/profile/petra-vertes-and-kirstie-whitaker) by Foreign Policy magazine.

### Application to join Tools, Systems and Practices for Data Science and AI Scoping Workshop

**Event website**: https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/tools-systems-and-practices-data-science-and-artificial-intelligence-scoping-workshop

**Application website**: https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/Scopingworkshopturing

**Date**: Submitted on 18 Feb 2019

*Questions not answered here*: Transparency agreement, contact details, GDPR consent to share contact information

**Current organisation**: Alan Turing Institute (research fellow) and University of Cambridge (senior research associate)

**URL of your Personal Webpage**: https://whitakerlab.github.io

*No CV uploaded as personal webpage exists*

**Career stage**: Mid (I'm not very clear about this, but early seems a bit of a stretch?)

**What is your personal motivation to attend and what do you think you’ll bring to the workshop?**

I applied to join the Turing as a research fellow in 2016 because it looked like an institute that could affect real change in how we do academic research at scale.
Its goal is to bring together people from different disciplines to produce impactful work that no individual would be able to conduct alone.
I am delighted that it is investing in the tools, systems and practices that are needed to make this ambition a reality.
I am particularly interested in the incentive structures, pedagogical requirements and interpersonal skills that facilitate participation in collaborative and open science practices.
Open science includes sharing data (which can be FAIR: findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, without necessarily being open), sharing code, participatory research with citizen and community scientists, making all research outputs open access, and building open educational resources.
In the first year of TSP funding I have lead "The Turing Way" project (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way).
Our interdisciplinary team of research software engineers, librarians, neuroscientists, data scientists and physicists are writing a handbook for reproducible research.
It includes chapters on version control, research data management, testing and continuous integration for research (among others), along with case studies and stories from data scientists trying to make their work reproducible "in the wild".
At the tools, systems and practices scoping workshop, I would like to present the progress we have made so far, and to see how we can integrate the knowledge and skills in the room (and beyond) into the Turing Way going forwards.
I will bring to the workshop an intersectional feminist perspective on using openness as a vehicle for justice.
In particular, I will contribute to building connections between people, projects and ideas.
I hope to collaboratively build a programme of work that is equitable and ethical, and that empowers data scientists around the world to make a positive impact by working together and for the benefit of all.

**Travel and accommodation funding requirements**: Return train from London to Cambridge (approx £50) and 1 night accommodation on 21 March (approx £150).


### Turing Health Programme Workshop (Application for talk)

**Date**: 7 & 8 March 2019

**Title**: Harnessing the power of participatory citizen science to share autistic people's experiences at scale

**Abstract**: [Autistica](https://www.autistica.org.uk/) and the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) are working together to build a participatory, citizen science platform to gather data on how sensory processing affects autistic people’s navigation of the world.
Numerous studies have confirmed that autistic people experience sensory processing differences, and that this can significantly impact their lives.
One aspect which is not yet fully understood is how these differences affect the ways in which autistic people navigate different environments.
In this talk, I will showcase the team's process of building a project that is participatory from the ground up.
We ensure that all aspects of the project are designed and developed in collaboration with members of the autistic community.
The platform will be developed under a free and open source license and we commit to making all software,design and process documents open from the beginning.
I will share our progress in building an providing citizen scientists with a fine-grained consent model that supports individual contributor’s personal preferences on how their data is used on the platform.
Flipping the traditional scientific study on its head, our goal is to give a voice to the autistic citizen scientists and educate neurotypical people.
We seek to empower everyone in supporting autistic people and their families in living long, healthy, happy lives.
