Online behaviour over the last months during the COVID-19 pandemic has shifted significantly. 
With buzzwords like “flatten the curve” and trending hashtags on Twitter like “#StayHomeSaveLives”, we have become more inclined to stay informed about what exactly is going on in our communities. 
Digital technologies and data-driven approaches have played vital roles during this situation in creating opportunities for us to take meaningful actions as leaders, researchers, innvovators and community members.
Already 100s of online projects have been launched to promote the development of technical solutions that can take on medical and social challenges related to coronavirus pandemic. 
There has never been a better time for online platforms and communities to thrive and test innovative ideas for a common social cause.
This is particularly empowering for individuals who want to lead and involve others in data-driven projects that identify interdisciplinary applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).
However, such efforts require understanding of project design, data management, software development, and continuous integration techniques: skills that are not widely taught to academic leaders and data scientists.

In this talk, I will focus on the importance of documenting and sharing knowledge around best practices in data science that can be adopted by various stakeholder in the current crisis and in the future.
Such resources, when collaboratively developed, can have a significant impact on improving access to information and the decision-making process by our peers and future generations.

I will introduce The Turing Way as an example for an open source project that is built upon a culture of collaboration and designed to be welcoming, inclusive and accessible to its members from diverse backgrounds and expertise. 
The Turing Way is a community-driven book project that involves and supports a diverse research community in ensuring that reproducible and ethical data research is “too easy not to do”.
It is openly developed, and all contributions, questions, comments, and recommendations are facilitated via our GitHub repository: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way.

Since last year, about 125 researchers have contributed to this project. 
They have co-authored chapters and developed resources that has been used by the scientific community worldwide in learning and promoting reproducible methods in AI and computational research.
As the project has grown from a small team of 10 researchers to a larger community of 125 collaborators, the scope of The Turing Way book has also expanded.
In addition to reproducibility, the project has expanded to include different aspects of project design, collaboration, communication, and ethics in data research. 

In the last 2 months, about 40 members have contributed to new chapters with best practices and recommendations on working from home and help other collaborate effectively (through virtual teams and events) during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
We continue to support our members in learning new skills and facilitate their interaction with the project via online co-working spaces and mentored contributions.

{Missing something}
We further invite CogX participants to make use of The Turing Way chapters and participate in its community by contributing and enhancing its resources and culture with their perspectives.
