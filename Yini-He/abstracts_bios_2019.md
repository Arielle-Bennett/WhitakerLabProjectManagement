# Abstracts and bios

This is a file of abstracts and applications for events I attend in 2019.

### Cambridge Networks Day

**Website**: https://www.cnn.group.cam.ac.uk/cambridge-networks-day

**Date**: 12th-13th September

**Application**: Networks are ubiquitous, and our brain is the most complex network in the world.
I hope to attend the Cambridge network day because there will be filled with interdisciplinary content.
I believe I could hear some advanced network method and learn some ideas and experience with analysis and applications of big data. 
I believe this knowledge will help to conduct research on the organization and activities of human brain networks and then explore the secrets of the major diseases of the brain.
I was attracted to Professor Danielle Bassettâ€™s topic.
I would like to know more about "Networks Thinking Themselves". 
She has rich experience to investigate dynamics system in human behavior and how brain connectivity is altered in neurological disease using algebraic topology and network control theory.
I believe there will be many creative speakers and they will give us inspiration.
