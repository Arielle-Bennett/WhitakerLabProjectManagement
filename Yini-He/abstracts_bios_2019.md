# Abstracts and bios

This is a file of abstracts and applications for events I attend in 2019.
### ABC2019

**Website**: https://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/events/ABC2019/pages/about-abc.html

**Date**: 12 & 13 September 2019

**Application**: I believe ABC2019 comprises very interesting sessions including ‘Reinforcement Learning’, ‘Vision’ ‘Mental Health’ and ‘Neuroethics of AI’.
All of them are the cutting-edge and interdisciplinary topics.
I have some reasons why I want to attend in this conference.
Firstly, I am interested in 'Dopamine and reward systems'.
I think reward drive us to do a lot of things. 
Dopamine is the pleasure response of the brain to reward.
I believe we could promote animal or AI to learn and do more things when we understand more knowledge about how dopamine function in reward learning.
Secondly, I would like to know more about some meaningful clinic questions such as how computationally defined treatment targets in depression.
Last but not least,I hope to see Kirstie host and introduce great people in the meeting.

### Cambridge Networks Day

**Website**: https://www.cnn.group.cam.ac.uk/cambridge-networks-day

**Date**: 29 August 2019

**Application**: Networks are ubiquitous, and our brain is the most complex network in the world.
I hope to attend the Cambridge network day because there will be filled with interdisciplinary content.
I believe I could hear some advanced network method and learn some ideas and experience with analysis and applications of big data. 
I believe this knowledge will help to conduct research on the organization and activities of human brain networks and then explore the secrets of the major diseases of the brain.
I was attracted to Professor Danielle Bassett’s topic.
I would like to know more about "Networks Thinking Themselves". 
She has rich experience to investigate dynamics system in human behavior and how brain connectivity is altered in neurological disease using algebraic topology and network control theory.
I believe there will be many creative speakers and they will give us inspiration.
