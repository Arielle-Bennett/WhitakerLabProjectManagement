# Lab meetings

Guidance for lab meetings can be found in the Whitaker Lab Onboarding repository: [Lab-meetings.md](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/Onboarding/blob/lab-meetings/Lab-meetings.md).

The table below outlines the lab meeting schedule for each quarter of the year.
The current quarter is at the top of the README file.
Previous quarters are in subheadings below.

The lab also has a [google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=7nar31c6ni4esif8fn1881kgds%40group.calendar.google.com) to help track the meetings.

The hackmd links for each meeting are not publicly available as they contain some conversations that lab members would prefer to keep private.
As a reminder, please **complete the HackMD in advance of the meeting** in order to facilitate conversations before and during the 1 hour time slot.
